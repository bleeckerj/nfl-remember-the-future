    "description": "A magazine of reported essays, profiles, criticism, and commentary on technology and society, written in a voice reminiscent of The Atlantic and The New Yorker—measured, literary, and skeptical of easy answers.",
    "content": "This issue explores the first years of widespread AI agency in the workplace, the rise of OpenBrain's Agent-1, and the social, economic, and political frictions emerging from the rapid acceleration of artificial intelligence. Drawing on scenario-based research and firsthand accounts, we examine the new realities of work, power, and risk in a world shaped by autonomous systems."

      "format": "Feature / Longform",
      "lede": "In the fluorescent-lit offices of a mid-tier software firm, the new AI agents are everywhere—and nowhere. They lurk in Slack threads, quietly refactoring code at midnight, or trawling the internet for obscure research. Their presence is felt most in the subtle shifts of workflow, the surreptitious hum of datacenter servers, and the anxious glances between engineers suddenly asked to 'manage' intelligences more capable at certain tasks than themselves. As the world acclimates to the first wave of truly autonomous AI employees, the gap between promise and reality—between cherry-picked demos and everyday unreliability—defines both the workplace and the wider social mood.",

The hum of vending machines and the faint click of a keyboard in an empty cubicle are punctuated only by the soft voice of an AI collaborator, piped in over a speaker, reminding a human project manager about an upcoming compliance deadline. As AI agents settle into the rhythms of office life—taking on complex coding projects, synthesizing research, and even drafting the occasional team memo—the boundaries between employee, tool, and overseer are blurring in ways both exhilarating and uncanny.",
