We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution.

We wrote a scenario that represents our best guess about what that might look like. It’s informed by trend extrapolations, wargames, expert feedback, experience at OpenAI, and previous forecasting successes.[2](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-2)

What is this?How did we write it?Why is it valuable?Who are we?

The CEOs of [OpenAI](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-sam-altman-interview), [Google DeepMind](https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis), and [Anthropic](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-01-21-2025/card/anthropic-ceo-says-ai-could-surpass-human-intelligence-by-2027-9tka9tjLKLalkXX8IgKA) have all predicted that AGI will arrive within the next 5 years. Sam Altman [has said](https://webcf.waybackmachine.org/web/20250106014723/https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections) OpenAI is setting its sights on “superintelligence in the true sense of the word” and the “glorious future.”[3](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-3)

What might that look like? We wrote AI 2027 to answer that question. Claims about the future are often frustratingly vague, so we tried to be as concrete and quantitative as possible, even though this means depicting one of many possible futures.

We wrote two endings: a “slowdown” and a “race” ending. However, AI 2027 is not a recommendation or exhortation. Our goal is predictive accuracy.[4](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-4)

We encourage you to debate and counter this scenario.[5](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-5) We hope to spark a broad conversation about where we’re headed and how to steer toward positive futures. We’re [planning to give out thousands in prizes](https://ai-2027.com/about?tab=bets-and-bounties#tab-box-bets-and-bounties) to the best alternative scenarios.

Our research on key questions (e.g. what goals will future AI agents have?) can be found [here](https://ai-2027.com/research).

The scenario itself was written iteratively: we wrote the first period (up to mid-2025), then the following period, etc. until we reached the ending. We then scrapped this and did it again.

We weren’t trying to reach any particular ending. After we finished the first ending—which is now colored red—we wrote a new alternative branch because we wanted to also depict a more hopeful way things could end, starting from roughly the same premises. This went through several iterations.[6](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-6)

Our scenario was informed by approximately 25 [tabletop exercises](https://ai-2027.com/about?tab=tabletop-exercise#tab-box-tabletop-exercise) and feedback from over 100 people, including dozens of experts in each of AI governance and AI technical work.

*“I highly recommend reading this scenario-type prediction on how AI could transform the world in just a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball, but this type of content can help notice important questions and illustrate the potential impact of emerging risks.”* —*Yoshua Bengio[7](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-7)*

We have set ourselves an impossible task. Trying to predict how superhuman AI in 2027 would go is like trying to predict how World War 3 in 2027 would go, except that it’s an even larger departure from past case studies. Yet it is still valuable to attempt, just as it is valuable for the U.S. military to game out Taiwan scenarios.

Painting the whole picture makes us notice important questions or connections we hadn’t considered or appreciated before, or realize that a possibility is more or less likely. Moreover, by sticking our necks out with concrete predictions, and encouraging others to publicly state their disagreements, we make it possible to evaluate years later who was right.

Also, one author wrote a lower-effort AI scenario [before, in August 2021](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6Xgy6CAf2jqHhynHL/what-2026-looks-like). While it got many things wrong, overall it was surprisingly successful: he predicted the rise of chain-of-thought, inference scaling, sweeping AI chip export controls, and $100 million training runs—all more than a year before ChatGPT.

the most important problem facing the country.

Foreign allies are outraged to realize that they’ve been carefully placated with glimpses of obsolete models. European leaders publicly accuse the U.S. of “creating rogue AGI” and hold summits demanding a pause, with India, Israel, Russia, and China all joining in.

A frantic energy has seized the White House. Even before the memo and public backlash, they were getting nervous: Over the past year, they’ve been repeatedly surprised by the speed of AI progress. Things that sound like science fiction keep happening in real life.[96](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-96) Many people in the administration are uncertain (and scared)[97](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-97) about what comes next.

They also worry that OpenBrain is becoming too powerful. Any misalignment risk from the AIs themselves is compounded by the risk that their parent company’s aims may diverge from those of the United States. All three sets of worries—misalignment, concentration of power in a private company, and normal concerns like job loss—motivate the government to tighten its control.

They expand their contract with OpenBrain to set up an “Oversight Committee,” a joint management committee of company and government representatives, with several government employees included alongside company leadership. The White House considers replacing the CEO with someone they trust, but backs off after intense employee protests. They announce to the public that OpenBrain was previously out of control, but that the government has established much-needed oversight.[98](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-98)

The concerned researchers brief the Oversight Committee on their case for stopping all internal use of Agent-4. They argue that everything is moving too fast, with years of progress happening in weeks. They argue that Agent-4 may be misaligned, their entire project is dependent on Agent-4, and if they continue trusting it there is a serious chance of AI takeover.

Other, less concerned researchers and executives present the counterargument: the evidence for misalignment is inconclusive. Meanwhile, DeepCent is still just two months behind. A slowdown would sacrifice America’s lead, unless the government can sabotage the Chinese project (likely to require kinetic strikes) or negotiate an eleventh-hour treaty. Both of these options seem extreme and unlikely. The CEO feigns neutrality and suggests a compromise plan in which Agent-4 undergoes additional safety training and more sophisticated monitoring, and therefore OpenBrain can proceed at almost-full-speed.

Our uncertainty continues to increase

At this point in the scenario, we’re making guesses about the strategy of AI systems that are more capable than the best humans in most domains. This is like trying to predict the chess moves of a player who is much better than us.

But the spirit of this project calls for concreteness: if we made an abstract claim about how the intelligence of the system would let it find a way to victory and ended the story there, much of the value of our project would be lost. Over the course of researching this scenario and running our tabletop exercises, we were forced to be much more concrete than in usual discussions, and so we’ve gotten a much better sense of the strategic landscape.

We’re not particularly attached to this particular scenario: we explored many other “branches” in the course of writing it and would love for you to write up your own scenario branching off of ours from wherever you think we first start to go wrong.

The slowdown ending is not a recommendation

After we wrote the racing ending based on what seemed most plausible to us, we wrote the slowdown ending based on what we thought would most likely instead lead to an outcome where humans remain in control, starting from the same branching point (including the misalignment and concentration of power issues).

However, this is importantly different from what we would recommend as a roadmap: we do *not* endorse many of the choices made in either branch of this scenario. (We do of course endorse *some* of the choices made, e.g. we think that the “slowdown” choice is better than the “race” choice.) In later work, we will articulate our policy recommendations, which will be quite different from what is depicted here.
