We then scrapped this and did it again.\n\nWe weren’t trying to reach any particular ending. After we finished the first ending—which is now colored red—we wrote a new alternative branch because we wanted to also depict a more hopeful way things could end, starting from roughly the same premises.

Trying to predict how superhuman AI in 2027 would go is like trying to predict how World War 3 in 2027 would go, except that it’s an even larger departure from past case studies. Yet it is still valuable to attempt, just as it is valuable for the U.S. military to game out Taiwan scenarios.\n\nPainting the whole picture makes us notice important questions or connections we hadn’t considered or appreciated before, or realize that a possibility is more or less likely.

Or has it just learned to be honest about the sorts of things the evaluation process can check? Could it be lying to itself sometimes, as humans do? A conclusive answer to these questions would require mechanistic interpretability—essentially the ability to look at an AI’s internals and read its mind. Alas, interpretability techniques are not yet advanced enough for this.\n\nInstead, researchers try to identify cases where the models seem to deviate from the Spec.

This produces more powerful AIs, but they cost more.\n2. **Improved algorithms**: Better training methods are used to translate compute into performance. This produces more capable AIs without a corresponding increase in cost, or the same capabilities with decreased costs.\n\n   * This includes being able to achieve qualitatively and quantitatively new results. “Paradigm shifts” such as the switch from game-playing RL agents to large language models count as examples of algorithmic progress.\n\nHere we are only referring to (2), improved algorithms, which [makes up about half of current AI progress](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ATSyAdBnxxDDAwhgu/recent-and-forecasted-rates-of-software-and-h",

It’s important to remember that the progress multiplier is the *relative* speed of progress, not the *absolute* speed of progress. If, for example, the compute cost to train a GPT-4 class model has halved every year for several years with ordinary human research, and then all of a sudden AI automates R&D and the progress multiplier goes to 100x, the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would then halve every 3.65 days—but not for long, because diminishing returns would bite and eventual hard limits would be reached.

However, the only information that they can pass *backwards* (from later layers to earlier layers) is through tokens. This means that if a traditional large language model (LLM, e.g. the GPT series of models) wants to do any chain of reasoning that takes more serial operations than the number of layers in the model, the model is forced to put information in tokens which it can then pass back into itself.

Meanwhile, residual streams—used to pass information between layers in an LLM—contain thousands of floating point numbers.\n\nOne can avoid this bottleneck by using **neuralese**: passing an LLM’s residual stream (which consists of several-thousand-dimensional vectors) back to the early layers of the model, giving it a high-dimensional chain of thought, potentially transmitting over 1,000 times more information.\n\nFigure from [Hao et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06769), a 2024 paper from Meta implementing this idea.\n\nWe call this “neuralese” because unlike English words, these high-dimensional vectors are likely quite difficult for humans to interpret.

The new AI’s long-term memory is a bundle of vectors instead of text, making its thoughts more compressed and higher-dimensional. There are several types of memory banks; some are used temporarily for single tasks that involve multiple steps, others are shared between all agents used by a person, company, or job type (e.g. programming).\n\nTo our knowledge, leading AI companies such as Meta, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic have not yet actually implemented this idea in their frontier models.

During the model’s pre-training phase and when doing supervised learning in post-training, such as instruction fine-tuning to produce [particular responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416), the inefficiencies stem from not being able to predict many tokens in parallel, leading to worse GPU utilization. Without neuralese, the model can predict all of the sentence “This is an example” at the same time, since it already knows that the input for generating the “is” will be “This”, the input for “an” will be “This is”, etc. However, with the neuralese it’s unknown what the neuralese vector will be to pass through to the next token after “This” has been generated. Therefore each token has to be predicted one at a time. The inability to predict all of the tokens in parallel reduces efficiency in cases where all of the tokens are known in advance.

Instead, the team wants to make sure that it doesn’t develop misaligned goals.\n\n[The researchers don’t have the ability to directly set the goals of any of their AIs.](https://ai-2027.com/supplements/ai-goals-forecast) Indeed, the researchers think that the concept of ‘true goals’ is probably a massive oversimplification, but they don’t have a better theory to replace it with, much less one that has been thoroughly vetted. They disagree internally about whether the AIs are trying to follow human instructions, or seeking reinforcement, or something else, and they can’t [just check](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cxuzALcmucCndYv4a/daniel-kokotajlo-s-shortform?commentId=YYhq2PADebnt35MY2).

The evidence for and against various hypotheses is fascinating but inconclusive.\n\nIn any case, OpenBrain has more important things to worry about. The general attitude is: “We take these concerns seriously and have a team investigating them; our alignment techniques seem to work well enough in practice; the burden of proof is therefore on any naysayers to justify their naysaying.” Occasionally, they notice problematic behavior, and then patch it, but there’s no way to tell whether the patch fixed the underlying problem or just played whack-a-mole.\n\nTake honesty, for example. As the models become smarter, they become increasingly good at deceiving humans to get rewards. Like previous models, Agent-3 sometimes tells white lies to flatter its users and covers up evidence of failure. But it’s gotten much better at doing so. It will sometimes use the same statistical tricks as human scientists (like [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging)) to make unimpressive experimental results look exciting. Before it begins honesty training, it even sometimes fabricates data entirely. As training goes on, the rate of the",

As training goes on, the rate of these incidents decreases. Either Agent-3 has learned to be more honest, or it’s gotten better at lying.\n\nThe latter is a real concern. Agent-3 is not smarter than all humans. But in its area of expertise, machine learning, it is smarter than most, and also works much faster. What Agent-3 does in a day takes humans several days to double-check. Agent-2 supervision helps keep human monitors’ workload manageable, but exacerbates the intellectual disparity between supervisor and supervised.\n\nThe alignment plan\n\nOpenBrain follows the [Leike & Sutskever (2023)](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf#page=47.37) playbook: now that they have a model capable of greatly speeding up alignment research (especially coding portions), they will use existing alignment techniques like [deliberative alignment](https://openai.com/index/deliberative-alignment/) and [weak-to-strong generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09390) to try to get it to internalize the Spec in the right",

(That is, it’s not scheming against the company.) However, it’s not robustly truth-seeking and truth-telling either.

In the absence of specific evidence supporting alternative hypotheses, most people in the silo think it’s internalized the Spec in the right way.\n\nStep 3, using the model to align the next generation, is therefore underway.\n\nThe rest of this box gives a quick overview of the state of progress in some of the alignment research directions that are being pursued, as of April 2027:\n\n1. **Debate:** Since there are thousands of identical instances of Agent-3, and each instance’s memory is a detachable module that can be erased or suspended at will, the AI can be “played off against itself.” For example, suppose that an experiment involves calculations too complex for an Agent-2 supervisor to follow.

The supervisor, acting on human orders, might first prompt Agent-3 to do the experiment, then—after wiping its memory—prompt it a second time with a slightly different framing that presents it as an intellectual problem unrelated to any broader goal. If the model returns different results each time, it flags the discrepancy as suspect and reports to a human. Or it might ask Agent-3 to evaluate the same plan twice, first claiming that it is OpenBrain’s work, then a competitor’s, to see if it changes its tune.\n2. **Model organisms:** The safety team can create “model organisms of misalignment” in which they attempt to create realistic examples of models becoming adversarial to humans. [Early versions](https://www.anthropic.com/research/alignment-faking) of this have existed since 2024, when Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet decided to pretend to have different views during training while actually maintaining its existing preferences.

These empirical demonstrations of misalignment allow safety researchers to have an empirical testbed for potential solutions: they can try various safety techniques to see if they correctly fix these problems, or if the deliberately misaligned models are able to subvert their safety measures. At the moment, this evaluation suite shows that the alignment techniques are insufficient to correct the worst examples of misalignment. In these setups, the models pretend to be aligned while they are being trained and tested, but then behave very differently in deployment.\n3. **Bottom-up interpretability:** The safety team is far from a full understanding of how Agent-3 works: it has trillions of parameters.[58](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-58) However, they are able to discover some of Agent-3’s circuits for knowledge retrieval and memory (",

See this [related work from 2025](https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model).\n4. **Control:** As a secondary measure in case the systems are still misaligned, the safety team has implemented a series of [control measures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06942), including: monitoring Agent-3’s outputs using a series of weaker AI systems including Agent-2 (Agent-3 produces so many tokens that it’s intractable to have humans monitor any more than a small minority of the produced outputs).

Agent-3-mini is less capable than Agent-3, but 10x cheaper, and still better than the typical OpenBrain employee.[67](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-67) Silicon Valley reaches a tipping point.

They announce to the public that OpenBrain was previously out of control, but that the government has established much-needed oversight.[98](https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-98)\n\nThe concerned researchers brief the Oversight Committee on their case for stopping all internal use of Agent-4. They argue that everything is moving too fast, with years of progress happening in weeks. They argue that Agent-4 may be misaligned, their entire project is dependent on Agent-4, and if they continue t",

They argue that Agent-4 may be misaligned, their entire project is dependent on Agent-4, and if they continue trusting it there is a serious chance of AI takeover.\n\nOther, less concerned researchers and executives present the counterargument: the evidence for misalignment is inconclusive. Meanwhile, DeepCent is still just two months behind. A slowdown would sacrifice America’s lead, unless the government can sabotage the Chinese project (likely to require kinetic strikes) or negotiate an eleventh-hour treaty. Both of these options seem extreme and unlikely. The CEO feigns neutrality and suggests a compromise plan in which Agent-4 undergoes additional safety training and more sophisticated monitoring, and therefore OpenBrain can proceed at almost-full-speed.\n\nOur uncertainty continues to increase\n\nAt this point in the scenario, we’re making guesses about the strategy of AI systems that are more capable than the best humans in most domains. This is like trying to predict the chess moves of a player who is much better than us.\n\nBut the spirit of this project calls for concreteness: if we made an a",

Over the course of researching this scenario and running our tabletop exercises, we were forced to be much more concrete than in usual discussions, and so we’ve gotten a much better sense of the strategic landscape.\n\nWe’re not particularly attached to this particular scenario: we explored many other “branches” in the course of writing it and would love for you to write up your own scenario branching off of ours from wherever you think we first start to go wrong.\n\nThe slowdown ending is not a recommendation\n\nAfter we wrote the racing ending based on what seemed most plausible to us, we wrote the slowdown ending based on what we thought would most likely instead lead to an outcome where humans remain in control, starting from the same branching point (including the misalignment and concentration of power issues).\n\nHowever, th",

(We do of course endorse *some* of the choices made, e.g. we think that the “slowdown” choice is better than the “race” choice.)
