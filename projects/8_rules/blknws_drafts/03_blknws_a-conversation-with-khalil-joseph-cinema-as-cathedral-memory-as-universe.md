# A Conversation with Khalil Joseph: Cinema as Cathedral, Memory as Universe  
*Interview by [Staff Interviewer]*

Filmmaker Khalil Joseph discusses his approach to cinematic worldbuilding, the legacy of Black storytelling, and why the future is a space to be invented—not inherited. In dialogue with fellow artists, he reveals how creative collaboration becomes a form of collective memory and resistance.

*Scene: A sunlit studio in Los Angeles, walls hung with stills from “BLKNWS” and old family photographs. Khalil Joseph sits at a long table, joined by longtime collaborators, editors, and sound artists. The room hums with the low-level energy of ongoing work—screens flicker, coffee cools, voices occasionally overlap in warm laughter. The conversation begins with a sense of reverence for the unfinished.*

**Staff Interviewer:** Khalil, your work often blurs the boundaries between documentary, installation, and narrative film. You’ve described cinema as a kind of “cathedral”—a place for collective release. How did that idea first take hold for you?

**Khalil Joseph:** I grew up in church. Not just as a place of worship, but as a space where stories and music and bodies all collide—where memory gets performed every week. Cinema, for me, always felt like it could be that: a gathering, a ritual. When I talk about a cathedral, I’m really talking about a vessel. It holds memory, it holds grief, it holds joy. The movies I want to make are less about answers, more about creating a space for people to feel—together.

**Collaborator (Jade, Editor):** Khalil’s sets feel like that, too. There’s a real intentionality about who’s in the room and what energy they bring. We’re not just making a product—we’re building a world, almost like a living archive. Every choice is about holding space for what might emerge.

**Staff Interviewer:** That sense of worldbuilding is so present in “BLKNWS”—part newsreel, part collage, part living document. How did the collaborative process shape that work?

**Khalil Joseph:** “BLKNWS” could only happen in collaboration. My brother [Noah Davis] and I talked a lot about the Black News Channel that never was—what it would mean to have a news cycle that actually reflected our realities, our humor, our pain. When we started assembling “BLKNWS,” it was never about a single voice. It’s a chorus. Editors, researchers, artists, even people who just wandered into the studio—all those perspectives layered in. That’s how memory works. It’s collective, it’s messy, it’s alive.

**Collaborator (Marcus, Sound Designer):** Sometimes we’d be working on a segment, and someone would pull up a family photo, or a snippet of a song their aunt used to sing. Those moments would end up in the final piece. It’s not about nostalgia—it’s about honoring the ways our histories are carried forward, sometimes in whispers.

*Narrative Interlude:  
The conversation drifts to the legacy of Black storytelling—a lineage both fragile and resilient, often carried in oral histories, home movies, and communal ritual. Joseph’s films, critics have noted, seem to stretch the definition of cinema itself, inviting audiences to inhabit memory as a living, breathing presence.*

---

**Staff Interviewer:** You’ve spoken about imagination as both inheritance and responsibility. In a moment when new technologies—AI, virtual worlds—are reshaping what we call cinema, how do you see your work evolving?

**Khalil Joseph:** We’re at a crossroads. The tools are changing fast—sometimes too fast for the institutions to keep up. But the core questions remain: Who gets to imagine? Who gets to remember? For me, the responsibility is to keep inventing spaces where our stories can unfold on our own terms. Technology can be a collaborator, sure, but only if it’s in service of that deeper purpose. I don’t want to inherit a future—I want to help invent it.

**Jade:** There’s this pressure to conform, to fit into formats that algorithms or markets understand. But the work Khalil pushes us toward—breaking narrative, refusing closure—it’s a kind of resistance. It says: Our lives don’t fit your templates.

*Narrative Interlude:  
Outside, the city is in flux. Streaming giants jostle for dominance, and new media forms—part game, part film, part live event—pull at the boundaries of the industry. Within these walls, though, the work is slower, more deliberate, more attuned to the vibrations of memory and possibility.*

---

**Staff Interviewer:** Looking back, what role has your family—and that sense of historical memory—played in shaping your philosophy of art as worldmaking?

**Khalil Joseph:** My family is everything. My mother’s stories, my brother’s paintings, my father’s records—they’re all in the work, even when you can’t see them. Black storytelling has always been about survival and invention. We’ve had to build worlds out of fragments, out of what was left behind. That’s the inheritance: not just the trauma, but the creativity, the joy, the relentless dreaming. That’s what I’m trying to honor.

**Marcus:** It’s like you’re building a universe from memory. Each project is a new constellation, but the stars are always those lived experiences—some personal, some shared.

---

*Narrative Interlude:  
As the interview winds down, Joseph reflects on the future—not as a fixed destination, but as a space to be shaped, remade, and dreamed into being. In this moment of industry upheaval, when the very meaning of “movie” is up for grabs, his work stands as a testament to the power of collective imagination.*

---

**Staff Interviewer:** Finally, what does creative collaboration mean to you now, in this uncertain moment?

**Khalil Joseph:** It’s everything. None of us can hold the whole picture alone. Collaboration is how we remember, how we resist, how we build futures worth living in. The cathedral is only as strong as the community inside it.

**Jade:** And the doors are always open.

---

*As the afternoon light fades, the studio fills with the quiet hum of ongoing work. Memory, invention, and community—these are the materials from which Khalil Joseph builds his cathedrals. In a world unsettled by new tools and shifting institutions, his films offer a different kind of blueprint: one rooted not in certainty, but in the shared work of imagining what comes next.*
