# Against the Flattening: Criticism in the Age of Generative Art  
*By [Arts Critic]*

On a rain-slicked night in Los Angeles, a local theater’s opening performance of a new play came unmoored when a lighting cue failed. The actors, caught in sudden shadow, hesitated—lines faltered, an ad-libbed joke fell flat, and the audience murmured in the dark. Yet as the cast regrouped, something electric happened: a hush, a recalibration, a shared vulnerability that drew everyone closer. The evening, imperfect and alive, became unforgettable—a moment forged in risk, error, and recovery.

It is precisely this kind of friction—unpredictable, awkward, generative—that stands in stark contrast to the seamlessness now promised by generative tools. In the past year, as so-called “possibility machines” have multiplied across creative industries, the rhetoric of frictionlessness has become a siren song. Studios and platforms, pressed by the demands of the attention economy, tout the speed and abundance of machine-generated scripts, storyboards, and visual effects. Scenes are conjured at a keystroke, edits made without sweat or struggle, and the barrier to entry for “content” has never been lower.

Yet in the rush to embrace these tools, we risk flattening the very terrain that gives art its power. The Mozilla Foundation’s recent Imaginative Intelligences Assemblies—gatherings of artists and thinkers convened to probe the future of creative purpose—surfaced a recurring anxiety: that simulation, however dazzling, cannot substitute for lived experience. One participant, a filmmaker known for her raw, improvisational style, spoke of the “necessary wounds” of her process—moments when a camera jammed or an actor wept off-script, derailing the day’s plan but giving birth to something truer. “Without that risk of failure,” she insisted, “the work becomes a simulation of itself. All surface, no depth.”

Generative systems, for all their utility, are engineered to optimize: to anticipate, to smooth, to fill gaps with plausible pattern. The result is often a kind of median art—work that is competent, even clever, but curiously frictionless. It is art without the sharp edges of doubt or the heat of genuine provocation. In the Assemblies, several participants described how these systems, trained on vast archives of existing media, tend to reproduce the familiar. “They’re like mirrors,” one musician observed, “reflecting back what’s already been seen, but never surprising you with what hasn’t.”

Such flattening is not merely aesthetic. It is existential. The lived experience of art—its capacity to unsettle, to interrupt, to demand something of us—depends on the possibility of failure. When a painting confounds, a poem stumbles, or a performance falls apart, it invites the audience into a space of uncertainty. This is where meaning emerges: not from the frictionless production of novelty, but from the messy, embodied labor of trying, failing, and trying again. As another Assembly participant put it, “Pain and risk are the price of admission to real mastery. Take them away, and you’re left with a simulation of growth, not the thing itself.”

None of this is to deny the genuine benefits of generative tools. They can democratize access, ease technical burdens, and spark new forms of collaboration. But the creative process—at its deepest level—is not a problem to be solved or a workflow to be optimized. It is a terrain to be traversed, with all the attendant hazards and joys. When we privilege frictionlessness, we risk losing the interruptions and provocations that make art matter.

In a moment when the industry is being remade—when the very notion of what counts as a “movie” or a “performance” is dissolving into new, still-unnamed forms—criticism must stand against the flattening. We must argue for the preservation of the messy, the embodied, the risky. Art’s value lies not in its ability to simulate experience, but in its power to make us feel—awkward, exposed, changed. The future of creativity depends on our willingness to court failure, to cherish interruption, and to insist that some things can only be made, not generated.
