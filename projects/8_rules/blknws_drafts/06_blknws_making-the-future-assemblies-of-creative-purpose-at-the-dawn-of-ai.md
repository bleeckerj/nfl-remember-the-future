# Making the Future: Assemblies of Creative Purpose at the Dawn of AI

_By Staff Writer_

In the echoing marble corridors of downtown Los Angeles’ Bradbury Building, the air trembled with a kind of nervous expectancy. Over the course of several weeks in early 2025, artists, technologists, writers, and performers gathered in rotating assemblies—their faces lit by the shifting glow of tablet screens and the golden hour sun filtering through ironwork. Each assembly was a living experiment: part symposium, part group therapy, part improvisational jam session. The question on everyone’s mind was at once urgent and elusive—what does creative purpose look like when the future is being drafted, seemingly in real time, by machines?

The gatherings, dubbed Imaginative Intelligences Assemblies, drew a crowd as motley as the city itself. There were veteran directors whose credits stretched back to the VHS era, digital-native poets who had never published in print, costume designers, TikTok collectives, indie game makers, and AI researchers with the cautious bearing of new diplomats. Mozilla Foundation and the Berggruen Institute had convened them not to produce a manifesto, but to witness the collision of anxieties and aspirations at the intersection of artistry and automation.

## The Pulse of Uncertainty

If there was a single, unifying current running through the assemblies, it was unease. In a circle of folding chairs, a screenwriter described the “phantom pain” of seeing a system generate dialogue in her own style: “It’s like being haunted by a version of myself that never sleeps, never gets blocked, never says no to a deadline.” A musician, whose last album had been algorithmically remixed into a viral trend, spoke of a “constant, low-grade dread—like I’m disposable, even in my own genre.”

Yet, for every voice mourning the erosion of creative authorship, another insisted on possibility. A young choreographer, still in her rehearsal tights, pointed to the way AI tools could “expand the palette,” allowing her to “sketch movement in code and then teach it to bodies—mine or others’—in the real world.” She described moments of surprise and delight, when a generative model’s suggestion led her into new territory: “It’s not about replacement. It’s about being challenged—sometimes even provoked.”

## Embodiment Versus Acceleration

Over plates of catered vegan tacos and cold brew, the assemblies wrestled with the accelerating tempo of creative production. Studios and platforms now demanded more content, more quickly, feeding a voracious attention economy. “It’s industrial,” one indie filmmaker said, “like we’re all working on the assembly line, except the line has no end and no union.”

But the room was far from resigned. There was a palpable insistence on the primacy of the lived, embodied experience—the sweat, risk, and serendipity at the heart of creative work. A theater director, her hands still stained with paint from set-building, described the necessity of “pain and friction” in art-making. “Without risk, there’s no revelation. The algorithm can’t be nervous before opening night.”

Others echoed this, calling for tools that didn’t erase the human messiness but instead made space for it. “We want systems that slow us down, not speed us up,” a novelist argued. “That push us to ask better questions, not just generate more answers.” There was talk of “possibility machines”—technologies designed not to flatten or automate, but to provoke, unsettle, and nurture.

## Resisting the Attention Machine

Throughout the assemblies, an undercurrent of resistance ran strong. Participants spoke of the “flattening” effect of industrialized media—how the logic of the algorithm rewarded sameness, passive consumption, and the endless scroll. “Our attention is the product now,” said a visual artist, “but our bodies know better. Real creativity happens in the in-between—when you get bored, or lost, or have to wrestle with something you don’t understand.”

Several groups staged spontaneous interventions: a silent walk around the block, a “slow looking” exercise with found objects, a collaborative poem written one word at a time on slips of paper. These were more than icebreakers; they were quiet acts of defiance against the pull of frictionless, automated engagement.

## The Weight of History, the Pull of the Future

The anxieties voiced in Los Angeles are not new. The history of creative identity is marked by recurring waves of technological disruption—the arrival of the camera, the phonograph, the synthesizer, the personal computer. Each time, the boundaries of authorship and artistry have shifted, sometimes violently. The difference now, many noted, is the speed and scale of change—and the sense that the very notion of a “movie,” a “song,” or a “creator” may be dissolving into something unrecognizable.

And yet, the assemblies returned, again and again, to the stubborn, irreducible core of creative purpose: the desire to connect, to share, to be seen and understood. “We’re not here to be replaced,” one participant said during the closing circle. “We’re here to make meaning—and maybe, if we’re lucky, to make the future a little bit more beautiful, together.”

For now, the industry watches and worries, experiments and resists. The shape of things to come remains uncertain—less a blueprint than a living, shifting assembly, still in progress.
