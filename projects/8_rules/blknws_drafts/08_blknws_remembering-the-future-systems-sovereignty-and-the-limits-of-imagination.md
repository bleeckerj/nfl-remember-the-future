# Remembering the Future: Systems, Sovereignty, and the Limits of Imagination  
*By Senior Essayist*

What does it mean to recover foreclosed possibilities and imagine otherwise in a world of entrenched systems? This question, at once intimate and political, lingers in the air of every conversation about creativity and freedom today. As Sadia Hartman writes, “to remember the future” is to reach for the lives and worlds that could have been—those pruned by history’s sharpest shears, their seeds scattered but never quite extinguished. In the shadow of new “possibility machines,” we are pressed to ask: Who gets to dream? Who decides what is possible, and what is forgotten?

## The Weight of Erasure

My grandmother kept her papers in a biscuit tin—old passports, faded photos, a ration card from the year she crossed an ocean. She rarely spoke of the country she left behind, but her silences mapped the boundaries of what could be remembered in our family. The stories she did share were usually fragments: a mango tree, a missing brother, a song sung to the moon. As a child, I sensed a double loss—not only of place, but of the futures she might have had if the world had not insisted on borders, if history had not demanded her flight.

Hartman’s notion of “the culling of alternative imaginaries” resonates here. Colonial archives, migration regimes, and the machinery of belonging have always policed the imagination, narrowing the field of what can be hoped for. These are not abstract forces; they are lived constraints, encoded in the way families remember—or cannot remember—their own beginnings.

## Systems and the Shape of the Possible

The movie industry, like so many others, is waking up to the ways that entrenched systems define the horizon of the imaginable. The arrival of new AI tools, for all their promise, has surfaced old questions about agency and sovereignty. Whose stories get told, and by whom? Which creative futures are supported, and which quietly erased?

At a recent gathering in Los Angeles—part of the Imaginative Intelligences Assemblies—artists and technologists debated whether these new infrastructures would expand the field of creative play or simply reinforce familiar hierarchies. One filmmaker, herself the child of two migrations, described the “strange déjà vu” of watching her own ideas about cinema dissolve into algorithmic logics. “It feels like we’re being asked to remember a future that hasn’t happened yet,” she said. “But everywhere I look, the archives are missing pages.”

The industry’s own history of exclusion—of women, of Black and Indigenous creators, of queer and immigrant voices—has always been a story of foreclosed possibility. Today, as diffuse networks and collective experiments challenge the centralized power of the old studios, there is both hope and anxiety. The center cannot hold, but what will grow in its place?

## Sovereignty and the Practice of Resistance

Freedom, Hartman reminds us, is not only a matter of laws or contracts, but of the imagination’s reach. In my family, sovereignty was always provisional: a matter of making-do, of finding cracks in the system and lingering there. My uncle’s stories—half-true, half-dreamed—were a kind of resistance. He called them “anarchist calisthenics,” a phrase I would only later encounter in James Scott’s work: the daily practice of preparing for freedom, even when it seems impossible.

Today, such practices are more necessary than ever. The proliferation of AI systems, platforms, and infrastructures brings new tools for world-making, but also new risks of enclosure. As platforms become more pervasive, the danger is not only that they will automate old exclusions, but that they will subtly shape what is thinkable, what is desirable, what is even visible as a future.

## Reclaiming Agency, Imagining Otherwise

How, then, do we recover the capacity to imagine otherwise? The answer is not simple, nor is it singular. It might begin in the refusal to accept the limits imposed by entrenched systems: to practice, as Hartman puts it, “the labor of world-making” in the face of erasure. It might mean telling stories that do not fit the available containers, or building collectives that are too dispersed to be bought or sold. It might mean learning to dwell in the “missing pages,” to treat the archive’s absences as spaces for invention rather than only for loss.

At a recent roundtable, a young animator spoke of “making futures out of fragments”—using AI not to mimic what has already been, but to conjure what was never allowed to be. “We are not just remembering the past,” she said. “We’re remembering the future.”

This is, perhaps, the most radical act: to insist that the imagination is sovereign, that the possible is larger than the systems that seek to contain it. In a world of possibility machines, the work is not only to build, but to remember—to recover the futures that have been foreclosed, and to imagine otherwise. The biscuit tin is never empty. There is always another story, waiting to be told.
