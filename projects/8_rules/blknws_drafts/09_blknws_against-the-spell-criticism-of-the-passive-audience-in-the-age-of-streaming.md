# Against the Spell: Criticism of the Passive Audience in the Age of Streaming  
*By Arts Critic*

In the waning light of a recent show at the Regent Theater, the crowd found itself not lost in the beat, but abruptly stilled. The singer—midway through a thunderous set—paused, letting the silence stretch until discomfort rippled across the room. “You can scroll later,” she finally said, breaking the hush. Phones lowered. Bodies shifted. For a moment, everyone was not an audience but an assembly, present and unguarded. It was a small act of defiance against the seamlessness of passive consumption that defines the streaming age—a reminder that art, at its most vital, resists sedation.

This moment was not an outlier. Across disciplines, artists are deploying interruption and provocation as tools of resistance, refusing the flattening that comes with industrialized attention. In an era when platforms algorithmically smooth difference, compressing music, film, and performance into an endless, frictionless feed, these creative choices stand as deliberate ruptures. “I want to break the trance,” says producer and composer Lina Okoye, whose recent album launches with an abrasive ten-second burst of static. “If you’re lulled, you’re not really here.”

## The Flattening Effect

The rise of streaming platforms has transformed the cultural landscape, promising boundless access while quietly standardizing experience. The logic of scale—more content, more hours, more engagement—has downstream effects on the work itself. Artists, pressured by the metrics of retention and skip rates, report a subtle but pervasive pressure: to smooth out the edges, to optimize for the algorithm, to meet the audience where it already is.

It’s not just the music. Streaming-era film and television, too, are shaped by this imperative. Scenes are trimmed for pace, hooks are frontloaded, and ambiguity is sanded away. “The risk is that everything becomes background,” says screenwriter Margo Lee, whose festival circuit short was acquired—but heavily re-edited—by a major platform. “You’re not supposed to stop and feel. You’re supposed to keep watching.”

The mass audience, once a site of collective energy, is now often fragmented and remote—each viewer alone, eyes flicking between screens, half-attending. The result is a kind of cultural anesthesia: a spell of passivity, easy to enter and hard to break.

## Embodiment as Resistance

Yet there are those who refuse to play along. Musicians and performers, in particular, are rediscovering the power of embodiment—the irreducible presence of the live moment—as a form of creative autonomy. At the recent “Interruptions” festival, audiences were invited to participate: to sing, to shout, to walk on stage. The result was messy, unpredictable, and, at times, deeply uncomfortable. “It’s a risk,” says performance artist Adrian Torres. “But it’s the only way I know to keep it alive. Streaming can’t do this.”

These moments of rupture are not nostalgia for a pre-digital past, but experiments in new forms of engagement. They acknowledge the realities of a changed media environment—one in which attention is both scarce and industrially managed—and insist on the value of presence, of risk, of being seen and seeing others. “Embodiment is a kind of protest,” Torres continues. “It’s saying: I’m not content. I’m not for sale.”

## The Consequences of Industrialized Attention

The industrialization of attention has produced undeniable benefits: democratized access, new audiences, and the possibility for work to travel far beyond its point of origin. But it has also introduced a new kind of vulnerability. When creative work is shaped downstream by consumer desire—by the invisible hand of the platform—artists risk losing not just autonomy, but the capacity to provoke, to discomfort, to wake us from the trance.

Some are fighting back, not by retreating, but by baking resistance into the work itself. Okoye’s static, Torres’s participatory chaos, Lee’s refusal to rewrite for “stickiness”—these are not simply aesthetic choices, but acts of survival. They are reminders that art, at its best, interrupts: it asks us to pay attention, to notice difference, to risk being changed.

## Beyond the Spell

As the lines between creator and consumer, performer and audience, continue to blur, the challenge is not merely to resist the flattening, but to reimagine what engagement can mean. The most vital work of this moment is not the most seamless, but the most disruptive—the work that wakes us, even briefly, from the spell.

In a world designed for passive watching, it is the artists who force us to look up, to listen, to be present, who are creating the future. Their provocations are not just acts of resistance, but invitations: to remember that art is not a product, but an encounter. The spell can be broken. The question is, who among us is willing to risk being awake?
