# A Living Archive: Khalil Joseph and the Collage of Black Imagination  
*Interview by Contributing Editor*  

*Director Khalil Joseph speaks on the making of 'Black News,' a cinematic universe that is less a film than a living, breathing space of memory, resistance, and vision.*

The studio is unassuming: white walls, modular chairs, a battered piano in the corner. Khalil Joseph arrives with a quiet gravity, his presence almost dissolving into the space, as if he belongs to the air as much as the floor. We sit. He is here to talk about 'Black News,' but quickly, it becomes clear that the project is less a film than a possibility—a living archive, a collage, an ecosystem of Black thought and dreaming.

**Q:** *You’ve described 'Black News' as an ecosystem, a continuum. What does that mean in the language of cinema?*

**Khalil Joseph:**  
*It’s the refusal to close the door. To say: this is the end, the credits roll, we’re finished. Black News isn’t a movie you watch and leave behind. It’s porous. It’s memory in motion. I’m thinking of my grandmother’s living room—how it was always full of stories, music, the news on low in the background, voices overlapping. That’s the container. It’s not realism in the Hollywood sense; it’s real because it’s lived. It’s ritual, it’s improvisation, it’s the sound of someone humming in the kitchen while the world outside is on fire.*

He pauses, and the silence is thick with the weight of ancestors. Joseph’s approach is less about rendering reality than about conjuring a space where reality is up for negotiation—a space that resists containment.

**Q:** *Hollywood is obsessed with world-building, but your work seems to resist fixed worlds. How do you navigate that tension?*

**Khalil Joseph:**  
*Hollywood wants a blueprint: build the world, map it, monetize it. But Black imagination was never allowed blueprints. We had to improvise, to collage. 'Black News' is a refusal of the master plan. It’s a way to say: our worlds are not static, they’re alive, breathing, haunted, full of rupture and repair. I think about Sun Ra, about Arthur Jafa, about Julie Dash—how they conjure worlds that are elastic, fragmentary, sometimes impossible. That’s the point: impossibility as a method. Imaginative leaps aren’t an escape; they’re survival. They’re freedom work.*

He leans forward, voice low.  
*We don’t render reality; we rupture it. We make room for the ghosts, the ancestors, the children not yet born. That’s the politics and the poetics, right there.*

**Q:** *There’s a sense of ritual in the work—a kind of collective memory enacted. How does personal memory feed into this collective archive?*

**Khalil Joseph:**  
*Personal memory is the seed, but the archive grows wild. My mother’s voice, the way my uncle told stories, the taste of Sunday dinners—those are portals. When I make, I’m not just making for myself. I’m listening for the echoes. Collective memory is a fugitive thing. It slips, it doubles back, it reinvents itself. The ritual is in the gathering: we come together, we remember, we dream forward.*

He invokes the work of Saidiya Hartman and Fred Moten, their insistence that Black life is always in excess of what can be captured, always spilling over the frame.

**Khalil Joseph:**  
*We have a responsibility—not just to document, but to imagine. To rehearse new ways of being. The archive isn’t just what’s been; it’s what could be. That’s the call: to make room for the possible, to resist being pinned down by what’s already known.*

**Q:** *With so much talk now about AI and new tools, do you see them as part of this continuum? Or is there a risk of losing something essential?*

**Khalil Joseph:**  
*Tools are tools. They can record, remix, even hallucinate. But the question is always: who’s holding the tool, and what are they listening for? AI can help us surface forgotten images, lost sounds—but it can’t improvise ritual, can’t mourn or praise or resist in the way we do together. The living archive is about proximity, about the collision of bodies, voices, histories. No tool replaces that. Maybe it can witness, if we teach it how.*

He smiles, a little wry, a little weary.  
*But the real work is always us. The gathering, the dreaming, the refusal to let the story end.*

**Q:** *So what does the future of Black cinema look like, in your vision?*

**Khalil Joseph:**  
*It looks like a room full of people who aren’t supposed to be in the same room, making something no one’s seen before. It looks like a collage, a ritual, a news broadcast from the future. It’s unfinished, unfinishable. It’s freedom work, always. If we do it right, no one will be able to name it. They’ll just feel it—like memory, like hope, like a song you can’t forget.*

As we end, Joseph stands, stretches, and disappears into the studio’s shadows. The conversation lingers: a living archive, improvising itself into the future, refusing to be contained.
