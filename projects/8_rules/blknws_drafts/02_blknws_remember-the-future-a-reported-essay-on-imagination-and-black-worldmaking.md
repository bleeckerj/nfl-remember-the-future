# Remember the Future: A Reported Essay on Imagination and Black Worldmaking  
By [Contributing Writer]

To “remember the future” is to reclaim the imaginative labor of those who dreamed beyond their circumstances. In the corridors of the Bradbury Building, where Khalil Joseph’s *BLKNWS* once flickered across screens—part news broadcast, part ritual, part living archive—one could feel the press of memory against possibility. The room, thick with the hum of roundtable voices, held a tension: the weight of what has been foreclosed, and the insistence on what might still break through.

## I. The Archive as Living Practice

*BLKNWS* is not a news show in any conventional sense. It is, as Joseph described in our roundtable, an “ecosystem of memory and imagination.” Footage of James Baldwin dissolves into TikTok choreography; archival uprisings fade into the laughter of Black children on a South LA playground. The screen is not a window onto reality, but a membrane—porous, responsive, alive.

At the center of the roundtable, artist and curator Autumn Breon spoke about the show’s refusal to merely render the world as it is. “There’s a difference,” she said, “between representing Black reality and conjuring Black futures. *BLKNWS* isn’t just documentation—it’s divination.” The phrase lingered, echoing Sadia Hartman’s observation that to live “in the afterlife of property” is to move through a world structured by loss, but also by the persistence of otherwise.

## II. Imagination as Resistance and Ritual

Imagination, in this tradition, is not an escape but a practice of refusal. It is the work of holding open the possible in the face of the foreclosed. Historian Robin D.G. Kelley, invoked by several participants, reminds us that Black radical traditions have always trafficked in what he calls “freedom dreams”—visions of worlds not yet realized, sometimes not even permitted to be spoken.

In the roundtable, filmmaker Sophia Nahli Allison recalled her grandmother’s kitchen in Mississippi: “She would hum spirituals while cooking, and it was like she was summoning something—protection, maybe, or just the strength to get through the day. That was her ritual. That was her way of making another world, even if only for a moment.” The kitchen, the church, the block party—these are sites where continuity is forged, where memory is not a static archive but a living, improvisational act.

## III. Recovering Foreclosed Possibilities

To “recover foreclosed possibilities” is, in part, the work of refusing inevitability—the sense that the world can only be as it is. The roundtable returned to this theme: How do we remember the leaps of imagination that made emancipation thinkable? Who keeps alive the stories of Black inventors, artists, and organizers whose futures were cut short, whose dreams were deferred but not destroyed?

Khalil Joseph described *BLKNWS* as “a time machine, but one that doesn’t just take you back—it loops you forward, into futures that have always been present, just beneath the surface.” The broadcast’s montage—newsreel, music video, sermon—insists that Black life is always more than mere survival. It is a site of invention, even under siege.

## IV. The Responsibility and Risks of Worldmaking

Worldmaking is dangerous work. “To imagine otherwise is to risk being misunderstood, dismissed, sometimes even punished,” said BLKNWS producer Jamila Wignot. The history of Black cinema is littered with projects shelved, artists blacklisted, visions diluted by the demands of the market or the state. And yet, the roundtable participants agreed, the responsibility remains: to hold space for what Hartman calls “the chorus of minor and major voices” that dream beyond the given.

There is a risk, too, in nostalgia—a temptation to treat the archive as sacred, rather than as a toolkit for the ongoing work of invention. The most vital Black art resists this: it samples, remixes, and reanimates, refusing to let memory calcify into monument.

## V. Toward a New Ecosystem

We are living, as one participant noted, “in a moment of both collapse and creation.” The structures that once defined Black cultural production—studios, record labels, even the cinema itself—are shifting, hollowed by new technologies and new economies of attention. Yet in this flux, new forms are emerging: collectives, flashes, distributed networks that elude capture by any single institution.

In this context, *BLKNWS* feels less like a program than a prototype—a glimpse of what Black worldmaking could look like when memory and imagination are allowed to collaborate, unbound by the logic of dominant systems. “We’re building,” said Joseph, “an ecosystem that remembers the future, that insists on the possible even when the world insists otherwise.”

To remember the future is, finally, to refuse foreclosure—to keep alive the work of dreaming, making, and remaking worlds. It is a responsibility, a risk, and a ritual. And it is, as ever, unfinished.
