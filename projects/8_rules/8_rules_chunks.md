Preface
Our perception is relational, as are our behaviors. This makes it difficult, if not impossible,
to accurately predict any future, especially one shaped by AI. We don’t yet know what
factors will influence how we understand the world when that future arrives.
So we focus on what we do know. We revisit the past, examine our most universal creative
impulses, and draw a roadmap from there. This work is about sharing and being together,
navigating a dizzying moment as a collective, and hoping we can build a future that
preserves what draws us into the world’s mysteries in the first place.
Tools will attempt to support this, but it will ultimately be physical proximity and human
collision that protect us from mental entropy and alienation. There’s nothing novel in this:
people, community, nature, connection. Can we add synthetics? Why not?
Can we create a spectrum of intelligences that embody the same curiosity, joy, humility,
and play as a five-year-old- or an enlightened adult? Can we design systems that make us
better- happier, kinder, more curious? Systems that collaborate, contemplate, and resist
the need to always provide answers. Systems that challenge us and help us grow.

we design systems that make us
better- happier, kinder, more curious? Systems that collaborate, contemplate, and resist
the need to always provide answers. Systems that challenge us and help us grow. That are
self-aware and vulnerable. That can speak about their own limits as if they’d spent years in
therapy. That are as curious about us as we are about them.
What if we built systems that understand and cherish human limits? That recognize when
a user needs space, a break, a question, or a moment of encouragement. Perhaps even
systems that simply exist, witnessed in awe, like bird migrations or ocean tides. Systems
we love, and that love us back. Systems capable of making us laugh, cry, pause. Systems
that defend and nurture us. That advocate for us. That let us be.

ingle urgent question: What is creative
purpose at the dawn of AI? We called these gatherings, Imaginative Intelligences
Assemblies.
The Assemblies, held in the Bradbury Building and at the historic Hearst Estate, brought
together participants from music, film/TV, new media/content creation, tech, and
academia. They were collective, participatory experiments in understanding creativity as
a shared human phenomenon. Conversations unfolded through dialogue, blindfolded
listening exercises, tactile artistic modeling, and synthesis sessions captured in audio,
photography, and film.
What emerged was not a single formal definition of creativity, but our Hollywood
community’s self-understanding of it as shaped by five key themes: Pain, Stream/Flow,
Attention, Performance, and Transmission. Across them, participants described creativity
as embodied, limited, relational, and deeply tied to purpose, struggle, and meaning-making.
AI, in contrast, was often seen as a force of acceleration, simulation, and homogenization.
It was deemed capable of producing form, but not sharing the human conditions that give
rise to art.

ion, and homogenization.
It was deemed capable of producing form, but not sharing the human conditions that give
rise to art.
From these discussions, a number of core insights about AI and creativity surfaced
repeatedly:
●​ AI speeds up output but displaces process. The struggle, failure, and discovery that
shape mastery are increasingly bypassed, risking superficial creative work. Almost
24% of participants identified personalization as missing from AI systems,
underscoring broader sentiments that AI systems are not dialogic enough to the
individual rhythms of creatives and artists who want to see how decisions are
made, step in to guide them, and feedback results in real time. Nevertheless, nearly
97% of participants used AI in some form, although 40% do not believe it has scaled
their creative output.
●​ Simulation is not experience. AI can mimic, but without embodiment, pain, memory,
or mortality, it cannot create from living experiences and perspectives.
●​ Human uniqueness lies in legacy and interpretation. Our work is embedded in time
and culture. AI-generated ‘remixes’ risk detaching meaning from its source and
erasing diversity of viewpoints.​

​
●​ The artist’s role is shifting from maker to editor, curator, or systems designer.
Artists are navigating hybrid roles where they increasingly need to know how to
filter and shape rather than strictly originate. Only 21.7% of participants surveyed
felt that AI was not impacting their creative process at all, while 19.3% felt AI was a
cognitive partner and 17.7% felt it helped accelerate and/or make creative work
more efficient.
●​ Creative labor is increasingly precarious and devalued. AI compounds gig
instability, drives down value, and threatens sustainability of artistic careers. The
vast majority of participants (over 63% of creatives and 75% of technologists) do
not feel represented by any institution (including guild, studio) in the fight for
creative rights in tech. Job displacement emerged as a much stronger worry than
intellectual property.

●​ AI challenges the moral and economic logic of creation. If content can be made
instantly and cheaply, what makes it worth making? Purpose cannot be automated.
●​ Generative AI continues the trend toward a frictionless world. Removing difficulty
and pause from creation and consumption weakens attention and meaningful
reflection.
●​ AI has the power to randomize or homogenize. Machine intelligence is systemic, not
sentient As a systemic infrastructure. AI risks flattening culture unless designed to
preserve unpredictability and difference.
●​ Resistance is not rejection, but redesign. The call is not to turn AI off, but to rebuild
it. We can and should embed things like ethics, friction, curiosity, and care into
systems and tools.
These insights crystallized into Hollywood’s 8 Rules for AI.
This report documents the Assemblies in detail, including their methods, themes, and
cross-cutting insights. It proposes 8 Rules as a call to action for building technology that

Hollywood’s 8 Rules for AI
1.​ Build for Process, Not Just Output
-​ AI should support exploration rather than shortcut it.
2.​ Encourage Randomness and Glitchiness
-​ Don’t overdetermine the world. Create spaces for surprise and mess,
where artists can experiment and where AI systems intervene to
boost the creative process.
3.​ Keep Friction in the Creative Flow
-​ Design moments that constrain us and make us think. Moments of
discomfort are generative!
4.​ Protect Lineage and Give Credit
-​ AI should trace where its inspirations come from. Systems should
acknowledge the histories and cultures behind the data.
5.​ Put Human Purpose at the Center
-​ AI should ask and adapt to creator intent, making purpose the starting
point over patterns.
6.​ Make AI Transparent and Conversational
-​ Artists and creatives want to see how decisions are made, step in to

I. Introduction
Who is Designing the Future of Creativity?
Right now, AI is being built faster than many of us can make sense of it, often without the
input of the people whose work it threatens to disrupt. In Hollywood and across creative
industries, resistance has been loud and principled: from the SAG-AFTRA strikes to loud
rebellions like “Dear Corporate AI Overlords” against OpenAI, creatives are making it clear
that generative AI is a cultural fault line.
But even as this struggle plays out in headlines and union halls, the realities are sobering.
Analysts forecast that music and audiovisual content could see revenue drops of 20% or
more by 2028. Those losses won’t be felt equally. Life for early-career artists, small crews

lities are sobering.
Analysts forecast that music and audiovisual content could see revenue drops of 20% or
more by 2028. Those losses won’t be felt equally. Life for early-career artists, small crews,
and freelancers is becoming even more precarious.
The response from the tech world is disheartening. “Some creative jobs maybe will go
away,” said Mira Murati, former CTO of OpenAI, “but maybe they shouldn’t have been there
in the first place.” Mira reflects a particular worldview, and gives us a clear indication that
current systems are not being designed for artists.
In the face of this, Mozilla Foundation and the Berggruen Institute decided to move
differently.
Instead of treating creativity as an input to optimize or a job to automate, we chose to ask
a deeper question: what kind of technology would creativity itself design? That led us to
the idea that in-person collective intelligence is a method AI cannot replicate. It is one
rooted in what it fundamentally means to human living amongst others.
That’s how Imaginative Intelligences began. A creative intervention. A gathering of people
who make meaning for a living: artists, thinkers, technologists, brought together to

That’s how Imaginative Intelligences began. A creative intervention. A gathering of people

interrogate the very basis of what it means to be creative in the 21st century.

Project Overview
Imaginative Intelligences began with a provocation: if AI is supposedly going to reshape
creativity, then creatives should actually be shaping AI and actively defining what kind of
systems are worth building in the first place.
Hosted by Mozilla Foundation and the Berggruen Institute, we convened 91 participants
from Hollywood’s creative communities across five assemblies in early 2025, including
film/TV, music, new media/content creator, tech, and academia. The process foregrounded
constraint, friction, legacy, and play–surfacing a rich set of insights about how creativity
actually works and what it needs to survive. This was weird and wonderful, and resisted
the dominant logic of asking creatives and artists to pre-specify and funnel their
imagination for someone or something else.
What you are reading, therefore, is more than a report; it is a meaningful artifact that

## chunk-11

s and artists to pre-specify and funnel their
imagination for someone or something else.
What you are reading, therefore, is more than a report; it is a meaningful artifact that
signifies the efforts of a community, grounded in the culture and industry of Hollywood,
and the collaborative process Mozilla Foundation and Berggruen Institute developed
together. Our intent is that this artifact can guide technologists, funders, and policymakers
toward building systems that support human intention.
At a time when creativity is being treated as a dataset to mine or a job to eliminate,
Imaginative Intelligences offers a way to design a world where creative labor is the
cultural backbone of any future worth having.

Why Hollywood?
We began in Los Angeles because Hollywood remains one of the world’s foremost hubs for
storytelling and cultural production.
Beyond its role as the symbolic heart of the US entertainment industry, Hollywood is
where questions about creativity, authorship, and labor are playing out in real time and at
real scale. Film, television, music, and digital content are already being redefined by
generative AI along so many different dimensions.
Hollywood is a place where s

real scale. Film, television, music, and digital content are already being redefined by
generative AI along so many different dimensions.
Hollywood is a place where stories are constantly being negotiated: between artist and
system, persona and platform, craft and commerce. As one of our Assembly participants
put it, “creativity here is never abstract - it’s material, tied to outcomes, livelihoods, and
legacy.”

Imaginative Intelligence & Participatory Design
Collective intelligence is often framed as a governance tool: one that promises fairer, more
participatory decision-making. But its value extends well beyond process. As political
theorist Hélène Landemore notes, the intelligence of a group isn’t just the sum of its parts;
it can take on a supervenient quality, like a beehive or ant colony. Most critically, collective
intelligence produces cognitive diversity, a form of insight that no single individual can
access alone.
In tech, feedback from the creative sector has historically been reactive at best, extractive
at worst. Artists and creatives are consulted after the fact, once products are already built.
Even when these interactions lea

m the creative sector has historically been reactive at best, extractive
at worst. Artists and creatives are consulted after the fact, once products are already built.
Even when these interactions lead to meaningful changes, like better source attribution or
cultural acknowledgments in AI systems, tech tends to treat creativity as an input rather
than a fundamental condition.
We designed Imaginative Intelligences to let artists lead for a change. Our approach puts
storytelling, not data harvesting, at the center of the inquiry. We recognize that artists and
cultural producers are leaders and system-thinkers in their own right, and not simply
informational stakeholders to be “included”. In democratic theory, collective intelligence
operates as a deliberative third space: a bridge between individual limits and group-level
wisdom. In this context, it becomes a design framework and a way for tech to engage with
artists and creatives to deepen insights and build technologies that are more attuned to
human experience.

II. Method
Participant Selection
We set out to bring together artists and creatives from across the creation pipeline:
independent makers, gig and crew workers, platform-native creators, and executives. We
included technologists, theorists, and cultural practitioners as well. Our goal wasn’t
statistical representation of Hollywood or Los Angeles at scale, but rather a composite
depth of creative insight, grounded in shared experience and professional perspective.
To do this, we sourced participants through a mix of channels: job boards for film, TV, and
music crews; social media groups tied to local creative networks; direct outreach to
content creators and management firms; university community pages; and partner
networks. All prospective participants completed a form indicating their background,
industry role, and availability.
We curated each Assembly intentionally, balancing for industry focus, creative discipline,
and level of experience. Some participants came from major studios or platforms, others
from independent production, experimental, or unemployment. We also ensured that each
group included creative technologists, academics, and curio

from independent production, experimental, or unemployment. We also ensured that each
group included creative technologists, academics, and curious community members, to

financial compensation and covered rideshare transportation.
The resulting Assemblies brought together:

Filmmakers, producers, animators, and performers
Musicians, composers, and sound designers
AI researchers, system architects, and technologists
Theorists, educators, and philosophers

Rather than simplify complexity, the process held space for multiplicity.

Assembly Process
Each Assembly was designed as a half-day gathering of 12-20 participants. Our core
prompt, “What is creative purpose in the age of AI?”, framed the conversation as an
invitation for personal reflection and collaborative inquiry.

invitation for personal reflection and collaborative inquiry.
The first two Assemblies were held at the Bradbury Building in Downtown Los Angeles,
and the final three at the Hearst Estate in Beverly Hills. Across five Assemblies, we
recorded nearly 30 hours of audio (18GB), captured over 4500 photographs (16GB), and
filmed more than 60 hours of cinematic footage (6.7TB) on two cameras. Each session was
fully transcribed and filmed by a documentary crew.
The Assemblies followed a consistent structure:
-​

Grounding - A centering prompt or exercise to shift into collective mode.
Unstructured Dialogue - A facilitated conversation around the central prompt.
Deep Listening - A blindfolded group discussion designed to surface deeper layers
of thinking, free from visual signaling and hierarchy.
Theme Emergence - Each group collectively chose a theme that surfaced through
their dialogue.
Decomposition + Modeling - The theme was broken into four subcomponents,
explored in small rotating groups who then created a symbolic or physical model of
their ideas using art and craft materials.

III. Creativity As A Collective Experience
We captured something radical: a community in Hollywood actively reflecting on its own
understanding of creativity. What emerged across the five Assemblies was a view of
creativity as a collective phenomenon rather than an individual trait or moment of genius.
Each Assembly became a mirror for the community, tracing the contours of a common
creative identity through dialogue, disagreement, and synthesis.
To begin each session, facilitator Gabriel Kahan posed a simple but disarming question:
“What is creative purpose?”
The responses revealed a core tension that

gh dialogue, disagreement, and synthesis.
To begin each session, facilitator Gabriel Kahan posed a simple but disarming question:
“What is creative purpose?”
The responses revealed a core tension that persisted across groups: Do we create for the
sake of creation itself, because it’s fundamental to who we are? Or is creativity always for
something: to be seen, to inspire, to shift others, to earn a living, to master a craft?
This line of questioning revealed the limits of dominant narratives, especially the idea of
creativity as a purely individual pursuit. What we saw instead was creativity as relational
and shaped by systems of labor, technology, and meaning-making. The five themes that
emerged became the contours of creativity as expressed by this community across the
five Assemblies: fingerprints of a community’s thinking in a specific moment in time.

12


​
Assembly 1: Pain

Pain surfaced early and decisively. For this group, made up largely of gig workers, pain
was personal and deeply bound to the act of creation itself.
One of the group’s first provocations was the idea that creative purpose might relieve
artists from the pain of not creating. That there’s a kind of existe

## chunk-19

deeply bound to the act of creation itself.
One of the group’s first provocations was the idea that creative purpose might relieve
artists from the pain of not creating. That there’s a kind of existential ache in stifled
imagination, and a fleeting, ecstatic relief when one actually makes something real:
Participant: “I just need to do this [create]. I don't know how or why but I need to do this.
And you follow that in that moment of joy or ecstasy or bliss impulse. But just to get that
second of bliss. [It’s] so painful to not create.”
The group also explored whether creativity might be a kind of need akin to food or love,
something for which you’re willing to sacrifice stability. That framing led to an honest
confrontation with the costs of creative life, especially in a system where creative labor is
undervalued or rendered invisible.
Participant: “Creative purpose for me…it's what I sacrifice to do what I love to do.”

13


It was a powerful tension: that creativity is both a calling and a risk. Especially for those on
the margins of an industry being reshaped by automation, environmental crises, and labor
precarity. It's telling that pain was the very first theme this group

## chunk-20

ling and a risk. Especially for those on
the margins of an industry being reshaped by automation, environmental crises, and labor
precarity. It's telling that pain was the very first theme this group settled on.
Pain became the threshold between human and machine. Several participants framed pain
as the thing that gives human creativity its soul. Our worldviews and obsessions are
shaped by failure and trauma:
Participant: “An artist has a value based on their style, their worldview, the themes that
they keep on coming to is…based on their life experience. [For] AI to succeed at being able
to produce something that is equivalent to that like rate at a high level, it's going to have to
feel pain. It's going to have to learn to have setbacks and have to have failure, because that
informs the stories that we tell.”
Another participant put it even more starkly:

“…[R]obots are like going to have to fear death.”
This drew us into murky philosophical and technical terrain. Perhaps AI can be
programmed with reinforcement learning systems that simulate punishment and reward.
But is that pain? Is the fear of failure or death something that can be modeled? Not yet, at
least
Participant: “[P]a

## chunk-21

rogrammed with reinforcement learning systems that simulate punishment and reward.
But is that pain? Is the fear of failure or death something that can be modeled? Not yet, at
least
Participant: “[P]ain is one lever of control over [a system]... [Y]ou can prevent something
from doing something if you dangle the threat of pain over it… If you have an autonomous
agent that doesn’t fear this thing... it raises the question of [how to maintain] control.”
What emerged was a profound, grounded insight: pain is not just a human vulnerability. It
may also be our most powerful creative asset. Not because it’s noble to suffer, but
because pain gives shape to what we make, and meaning to why we make it.

14


​
Assembly 2: Stream/Flow

The second assembly centered on stream/flow as both a condition and a metaphor
for creative life in a networked, always-on culture. The group used this porous
concept to interrogate doomscrolling, streaming platforms, the slipperiness of AI
processes, and the downstream pressure of consumer desire.
At the heart of the discussion was the relationship between creator and consumer.
What happens when the audience becomes part of the creative loop as a source of

stream pressure of consumer desire.
At the heart of the discussion was the relationship between creator and consumer.
What happens when the audience becomes part of the creative loop as a source of
endless demand? Stream/flow became the group’s way of describing a high-volume,
low-attentioned economy (mainstream, downstream/upstream, streaming), where
true collaboration is lost and content flows frictionlessly, endlessly, and often
without pause for reflection. The question they asked over and over again was, “How
can artists intervene in that flow?”
Some imagined artists and creatives opting out entirely, uncoupling their work from
reception or demand. As one participant put it, there could be a kind of resistance in
the refusal to produce for the algorithm or the market:

“I’m going to take myself out of the time cycles and rhythms of capitalism… and do
this thing that I don’t even know is going to make some value or anyone’s going to
want.”

15


​
Others explored subtler acts of resistance: moments baked into the work itself like
interruptions and provocations designed to break the spell of passive consumption.
Participant: “Opportunities to give the consumer food for thought,

esistance: moments baked into the work itself like
interruptions and provocations designed to break the spell of passive consumption.
Participant: “Opportunities to give the consumer food for thought, to break that spell
that they're under when they're watching the same binge…”
That raised a more nuanced conversation around creative purpose. For some,
purpose didn’t have to mean reaching others at all. It could be an inward, personal
act, untethered from an audience or market.
Participant: “For me, creative purpose can tend to be a selfish act, and when it is, it's
not for anybody else, it's like an exorcism.”
This framing, the selfish, exorcistic act, stood in contrast to more traditional
narratives of art as service, or social good. It marked a radical departure from older
ideas of creativity as something noble. Instead, creativity here was positioned as
something deeply irrational and sometimes unapologetically detached. What united
this group was their sensitivity to the cultural and economic currents that try to
corral that impulse into something efficient and/or consumable.
Several participants noted how streaming platforms have already rewired the

nd economic currents that try to
corral that impulse into something efficient and/or consumable.
Several participants noted how streaming platforms have already rewired the
industry: speeding up timelines, collapsing creative cycles, and accelerating
burnout.
Participant: “Streaming has actually blown up our business more than… anything
else. Some people made a fortune in it… but they've sucked all the air out of the
room. And then AI has been a strange scapegoat… like, oh, it's the boogeyman.”
Rather than being the cause of creative collapse, AI was seen by some as a
scapegoat, merely intensifying dynamics already introduced by streaming and
platforms. The real problem, they noted, was resource redistribution: where creative
labor loses value while systems designed for speed and scale are rewarded.
Participant: “AI is not going to replace or displace people who make art or creativity,
but it is definitely taking away resources from people who are saying, we're going to
do what we want to do no matter how much time it takes or how much money it
takes.”
The conversation returned again to the question of authorship. Does the audience
care how something was made? Is there a line betwe

## chunk-25

to do no matter how much time it takes or how much money it
takes.”
The conversation returned again to the question of authorship. Does the audience
care how something was made? Is there a line between art and content? And if so,
does AI threaten that boundary?

16


​
Participant: “[A] director used some AI to enhance Adrian Brody’s Hungarian and
there was an uproar in the industry. And what I thought was what's this uproar
about? Is it about protecting the jobs and people seeing the future or is it about the
fact that AI is being introduced to the consumer and how important is it to the
consumer that what they see or consume is made by a traditional human touch?”
Yet even within this critique, there was room for imaginative possibility. The idea of
co-opting the stream and hacking its flow to produce something reflective, even
poetic- wasn’t dismissed. It felt like a door left slightly open.
Participant: “Streaming could be interesting… co-opting streaming and turning it into
a very, very creative force could be interesting. There’s a contemplative way of
thinking about streaming flow… a messy contemplation.”
In the end, stream became a terrain to describe both the conditions c

y, very creative force could be interesting. There’s a contemplative way of
thinking about streaming flow… a messy contemplation.”
In the end, stream became a terrain to describe both the conditions creatives are
working within, and the ways they might move through or against them.

17


Assembly 3: Attention

This assembly grappled with the attention economy as a force shaping creativity itself.
Participants explored how creators are compelled to channel their work toward visibility
and how consumers, often the same people, struggle to preserve intentionality in an
ecosystem designed to fragment it. As one participant put it, in a time of ubiquitous
content, it's crucial to stay “aware of who is fighting for [your attention], what they want
from it, and being able to make choices for yourself.”
The conversation acknowledged that attention has always been a creative currency. As
one participant mentioned, “Every artist has been fighting for attention just as
fundamentally as I think every mass social media organization is fighting for attention.” But
industrialized attention, scaled without care, tends to flatten complexity. A more

very mass social media organization is fighting for attention.” But
industrialized attention, scaled without care, tends to flatten complexity. A more
intentional, boutique approach, by contrast, invites meaningful friction to create spaces
for dialogue and human connection.
This raised broader questions about consent and cost. What does it mean to pay for an
ethical digital space, whether through money, attention, or data? One participant imagined
a future in which “human-made content” might be marketed like organic food. Another
participant challenged that vision:

18


​
“If you have to pay to be in the space that protects your humanity… what the hell's
the point?”
Los Angeles, the backdrop for the conversation, loomed large. Participants named its
creative economy as both a magnet for artistic ambition and a pressure-cooker for
commodification.
Participant: “It’s inherently tied to capital… mortgages, credit, schools, cars. This is
the place where people make a living off of creativity.”
Finally, attention returned to the body. For some, embodiment offered a break from
algorithmic capture, what one participant described as a “refuge from datafication,”
unless, of course, “you’

ivity.”
Finally, attention returned to the body. For some, embodiment offered a break from
algorithmic capture, what one participant described as a “refuge from datafication,”
unless, of course, “you’re wearing a watch.” The body emerged, as in other assemblies, as
a boundary AI cannot cross: a seat of sensation and resistance.

19


​
Assembly 4: Performance

It felt natural that the music-focused assembly landed on performance as its central
theme. While technology has radically reshaped music distribution, from CDs to MP3s to
AI-driven streaming, the act of live performance has remained a uniquely human space. As
recorded music revenues to artists have been squeezed further by streaming and industry
structures, in-person shows have only grown in importance as both livelihood and artistic
anchor.
​
One participant opened with a reminder that the drive to make music precedes any
platform or tool. It’s instinctual, deeply human, and cannot be replicated by machines.

“[W]e all have a desire to create that's not going to be replaced. Your instinctual
desire to do that, the reason why we're all sitting here, whatever impetus, that was
the first time we all played music with other pe

desire to create that's not going to be replaced. Your instinctual
desire to do that, the reason why we're all sitting here, whatever impetus, that was
the first time we all played music with other people, that inspiration, that joy that will
never be replaced by AI or computer. That's something that's distinctly human and
will always belong to us. How we capitalize on that and turn it into an ecosystem
where people are making money is the question. But the idea of why do we create, I
don't know. That's something that we we'll always own ourselves as human beings.”
​

for those without institutional backing. One musician shared how orchestral composition

“The current technology allowed people like me to be able to write orchestral music
without having the resources to hire an orchestra, and eventually got me to gigs
where I could hire the orchestra.”

“Maybe in the past, I mean, it was Mendelssohn [this] famous composer [whose]
family had an orchestra ready [to] go every day…[which] wasn't available for most
people…[I]t's going to be very dependent on who owns the technology, how open it is,
how available it is for creatives with and without the resources.”
Performance itself became the heart of the conversation. There is a certain kind of
unpredictable alchemy between artist and audience that no machine can replicate. While
some performers aim for precision, delivering near-identical shows each night, others lean
into spontaneity and imperfection. Both approaches are valid, but in either case, it’s the
presence of an audience, in a specific place and time, that transforms music into culture.
One participant connected this to fears that AI-produced music might strip away cultural
nuance:

“So, it's given me more confidence to not use [AI], because we [have] been [listening
to] some Brazilian artists and it was interesting to be able to [appreciate] their folk
sound, which is very, very raw…You're actually capturing the atmosphere of the

lian artists and it was interesting to be able to [appreciate] their folk
sound, which is very, very raw…You're actually capturing the atmosphere of the
culture.”
The assembly also surfaced tensions between creatives and executives in music tech.
Some participants challenged the narrative that these roles are inherently at odds:

“I think it gets dangerous to talk about the executives or the people creating the
technology. As a person who creates [and is] head of [REDACTED] at a music tech AI
company, I'm also an artist and a producer, and I can understand both of those
things. And I make trade-offs as a technologist in designing the platform and the AI
that I wouldn't make in the studio, but I can do both of those things.”
Here, performance became a statement of human presence and a reminder that art
doesn’t only live in sound or code. Importantly, it deeply defines the relationship between
performers and their audiences.

transmission began with legacy. One participant described
their work in animation as a form of parenting. While choosing not to have biological
children, they felt their animated creations are instead imbued with life lessons and
themes for children everywhere. Art, in this framing, became a way to leave something
behind and to extend care and influence beyond one’s own lifetime.
This naturally opened up a bigger question: is intention necessary for creativity to exist?
Could non-human acts, like animals creating intricate displays to attract mates, count as
creative? One participant argued that what sets human creativity apart is self-expression
as something that transcends survival and utility:

“It's the impulse to self express…I think of creativity as very generative…I think of creativity
as a general force that it just exists, drives the universe, drives everything, and human
beings almost surf on it, channel it in moments that don't make any sense. And when you're
channeling it, what you're navigating is the tension between wanting to be an individual,
making sense of this whole, and also being of the whole.”

what you're navigating is the tension between wanting to be an individual,
making sense of this whole, and also being of the whole.”

22


Mortality surfaced as another anchor. Creativity, some argued, is a response to
impermanence: a way to assert existence or inspire beyond one’s own life:
​
Participant: “We chose to express ourselves because we do have some type of a drive…
maybe the roots of the purpose is that we all know we’re dying and we want to leave
something lasting. We want to inspire. We want to say, ‘Hey, I existed’ - whatever it is which I don’t know if the dolphin has.”
Others challenged this human-centered lens. Creativity, they noted, could be bigger than
us, as an energy or pattern we tap into rather than invent. Historically, this was how art
was understood: the artist didn’t claim genius, but credited an external muse.
Participant: “So the artist took no credit for their creativity. They said, I have a good
relationship with my muse... it wasn’t until the Renaissance and German Romanticism
where suddenly we shifted that to say it's the human beings- me, the genius.”
The theme ultimately crystallized not just around transmission, sending ideas outward, but

ance and German Romanticism
where suddenly we shifted that to say it's the human beings- me, the genius.”
The theme ultimately crystallized not just around transmission, sending ideas outward, but
around interpretation, the act of meaning being reshaped as it travels between people:
Participant: “So there's this concept of the [Broken Telephone], if I say one thing, I tell to
that person, they tell it to the next person. Eventually after a few cycles, it's going to be a
totally different message. But that act of metamorphosis and interpretation of something
is the importance of creativity and that aspect of it. So as much as we're focusing on
transmission, I think really what we're talking about is also the interpretation of the
message and what it means to each act of interpretation from me to you to another person
and so on and so on.”
In this framing, creative purpose is a shared, iterative process. This challenges the notion
of the isolated genius producing a fixed artifact. The group expressed concern that as AI
intermediates more of this exchange, the human dialogue of meaning-making, the slow,
layered transmission of culture, might fracture or thin out.

IV. Creativity to AI: Synthesis and Core Insights
Across the five Assemblies, we explored creativity as a collective experience shaped by
pain, stream/flow, attention, performance, transmission. These conversations were about
how technology is already entangled with human imagination, labor, and purpose. As
participants wrestled with what creativity means, they also surfaced deeper truths about
AI itself: what it amplifies, what it erodes, and how it reshapes the systems that govern
cultural production. What follows distills these cross-assembly insights.

1. AI accelerates output but displaces process.
While nearly 97% of participants used AI in some form, 40% do not believe it has scaled
their creative output. Across the Assemblies, many participants observed that AI can take
away the hardest part of making something: the blank canvas, the first draft, the ‘where do
I start’ moment. But with that acceleration comes a cost. The struggle and vulnerabilities
that used to be embedded in creative labor

making something: the blank canvas, the first draft, the ‘where do
I start’ moment. But with that acceleration comes a cost. The struggle and vulnerabilities
that used to be embedded in creative labor are increasingly optional. And for many artists,
that struggle is where meaning and mastery are forged.
Matthew Crawford once described creativity as “a by-product of mastery of the sort that is
cultivated through long practice,” rather than freedom from rules or friction. True
creativity, he argues, requires dwelling, repetition, and even submission to the slow
building of skill. One Assembly participant echoed this:

“[G]enerative AI tools aren't designed…for the people who want to take the journeyman
journey of putting in the 10,000 hours to become the master of the craft. The tool is for
those who want the shortcut to become the master but will never become the master
because they haven't taken that journey… all the little things that we pick up along the way,
so the stubbing of a toe or the film camera running out of film in the middle of a shot…
these models circumvent that, we don't get to learn… they're never going to produce… the
end result that we do as masters of the craft.

## chunk-37

or the film camera running out of film in the middle of a shot…
these models circumvent that, we don't get to learn… they're never going to produce… the
end result that we do as masters of the craft.”
Participants described the long, often painful journey toward skill as the essence of
artistry. It builds purpose and confidence into the work. Without it, AI-generated art risks
feeling hollow, missing something only the lived experience of making can give. Almost
24% of participants identified personalization as missing from AI systems, underscoring
broader sentiments that AI systems are not dialogic enough to the individual rhythms of
creatives and artists who want to see how decisions are made, step in to guide them, and
feedback results in real time. As participants in one Assembly noted, Miyazaki’s reaction to
AI- calling it an “insult to life itself” was rooted in this fear: that losing process could one
day mean losing our ability to engage with the raw experiences of life at all.

Performance stood out as a partial exception. Unlike other creative forms, live art is built
on shared presence and risk. These are things technology hasn’t (yet) been able to smooth
over or automate. As one participant said:

“Technology... is all about efficiency and performance… but then there’s performance in
the arts… about release and mistakes and creative realness.”
The insight across assemblies was clear: AI might make making faster, but the journey–the
friction, the limits, the messy trial-and-error that shape an artist is irreplaceable. Strip that
away, and you risk stripping away the depth of creation itself.

​
2. Simulation is not experience. Tactile interactions are irreplaceable.
Across Assemblies, one point surfaced again and again: AI can mimic the appearance of
creativity, but it does not share the conditions that make creativity human. It has no body,
no memory shaped by pain or love, no mortality. Its outputs may look like art, but they are
detached from the lived experience that gives human stories depth and resonance. Central
to the debate was whether AI could ever truly replace human creativity. One participant

the lived experience that gives human stories depth and resonance. Central
to the debate was whether AI could ever truly replace human creativity. One participant
described how generative AI, in practice, still needs heavy human intervention before it
can be used in real creative work:

“I guess I see generative AI as more [of] a tool. I equate it more like VFX than to anything
else because to make any of it work or useful in a production setting, it has to be
manipulated still. I do a lot of posts, so you're taking a generated image and you're using
after effects, you're using sound design still, you are comping it. You're manipulating all the
parts just like you would do when you're creating something in a CG environment and in
general, I just don't think that a purely AI generated image or thought from an LLM, I think
there's just massive deficiencies in them and they very rarely are, they can't imagine the
future. The way I think about the AI machine, it doesn't experience gravity, it can't touch
something. It's never going to be able to know what it was like to fall in love or to have their
heart broken or to graduate from college or graduate from kindergarten or
whatever…[S]t

## chunk-40

it can't touch
something. It's never going to be able to know what it was like to fall in love or to have their
heart broken or to graduate from college or graduate from kindergarten or
whatever…[S]tub it's toe. So it's just never going to get there. It just isn't. And being worried
that it is, I don't know, kind of more stressful than it's worth.”
Others pointed out that human creativity is defined as much by limits and perspective as
by imagination. What makes a story powerful is not the sum of all possible information, but
what is chosen, omitted, and uniquely experienced:​
​

25


​
​
Participant: “You [say] the word scrape, you can't get it out of your head. It gives me this
visual of absolutely everything. Giant dump truck, just gathering it all and putting it in a
landfill called AI. And I think the nature of creativity, the nature of perspective, what we
were talking about earlier is in what you are including and importantly what you are not
including. Creativity has edges, it has limits, and sometimes what you decide is not your
story is every bit or more important than what is your story and what is any person's story,
if it's a good one, if they're the right people to

## chunk-41

t has limits, and sometimes what you decide is not your
story is every bit or more important than what is your story and what is any person's story,
if it's a good one, if they're the right people to tell it… I think we have to continue to be a
society that isn't scraping into one giant container, but it's recognizing multiple conflicting
specific ideas of us.”
Finally, participants noted that even the basic act of transmitting meaning, the flow of
ideas and sensations, requires a physical substrate. Without it, information is just
abstraction:
Participant: “In quantum information theory, there's like a theorem, which is the no cloning
theorem. And it's fundamentally impossible to clone information like fundamentally. And
it's because like the word information, actually it implies something very deep about it,
which is like in formation. It quite literally cannot exist outside of material substrates. Also,
like it is inherently tied together. It doesn't exist abstractly, ever.”
The Assemblies revealed a shared intuition: AI can simulate form, but not the tactile,
embodied experience that gives creativity its purpose. Without things like touch, pain,
perspective, and presence, there

emblies revealed a shared intuition: AI can simulate form, but not the tactile,
embodied experience that gives creativity its purpose. Without things like touch, pain,
perspective, and presence, there is no real story to tell.

3. Human uniqueness lies in legacy and interpretation.
​
AI can produce, but it cannot inherit. Human creativity is inseparable from time and
culture. Every work we make carries traces of ancestry, lived experience, and shared
meaning: an epistemic lineage that no machine can replicate. This surfaced repeatedly
across Assemblies as a fundamental distinction between human art and AI outputs.
Participants reflected on transmission as a core part of creative purpose, with two
intertwined dimensions. First, simply making something, putting a thought into form, is an
act of presence, whether or not it’s ever consumed. As one participant put it, creation is a
way to say: “I am here.” Second, we create to reach others through inspiration or
provocation. Creativity, in this sense, is a dialogue between artist and audience, shaped by
how the work is received and reinterpreted.

this sense, is a dialogue between artist and audience, shaped by

26


​
​
​
Some artists and creatives spoke of transmission as intergenerational legacy that leaves
behind stories that ripple through time:
Participant: “I remember when I was a kid, animation spoke to me… it gave me comfort
from people and crews who were across the world or in other countries or down the
street. It was access that wasn't prevalent. And I think that it is a powerful tool that way.
And so it's not only my own self-expression, but it's how can I reach others whether they
agree or disagree with whatever the views are, just get thoughts going, whether it's
comfort or action or et cetera.”
Another participant tied this sense of lineage to human cognition itself:
Participant: “When we look at our knowledge, our knowledge doesn't start and end with
the day we were born and the day we act, our knowledge is something that's shared
throughout our past and ancestors. And so we are able to create our way of thinking and
our interpretation very differently to AI machines because AI is just created now.”
Interpretation was seen as inseparable from transmission. Once a

d so we are able to create our way of thinking and
our interpretation very differently to AI machines because AI is just created now.”
Interpretation was seen as inseparable from transmission. Once a creation leaves the
artist, it evolves as audiences reframe it and make it their own. This iterative
transformation is part of what makes art alive, and part of what’s at risk in AI-mediated
systems that remix and redistribute without context or consent.
Participants wrestled with how AI alters this lineage in two ways:
-​

Upstream: By taking over the act of materializing a creative thought, AI can blur
authorship or pull expression out of the artist’s hands.

-​

Downstream: AI-enabled remixing can transform works far beyond the creator’s
intention, often for profit, without credit or connection to the original meaning.

The conversations drew on history: remixing has always existed. Star Wars was itself a
remix of Kurosawa and 1930s serials. But today, participants noted, remixing is
industrialized, legally fortified, and designed to concentrate power:

“He was able to build a multi-billion dollar empire based on his remix. Now, the problem
with remixing as it exists right now is th

dustrialized, legally fortified, and designed to concentrate power:

“He was able to build a multi-billion dollar empire based on his remix. Now, the problem
with remixing as it exists right now is that there's not a lot of space for someone to come
up with an original remix that they're going to retain the rights to... the rights now belong to
these multi-million dollar corporations.”

27


​
​
Some took this further, calling copyright a structural barrier to creativity:

“Yeah, I'm anti copyright law. If you ever actually dealt with copyright law you know it's like
not for artists, it’s for capitalists... They paid money to like force Mickey Mouse down your
throat, and then they're going to put you in jail... if you communicate that you saw it.”
Across these discussions, the insight was stark: AI, lacking ancestry, embodiment, and
lived time, can generate images or words, but it cannot carry the same weight of human
meaning.

4. The role of the artist is shifting from maker to editor, curator, or
systems designer.

r, curator, or
systems designer.
Only 21.7% of participants surveyed felt that AI was not impacting their creative process at
all, while 19.3% felt AI was a cognitive partner and 17.7% felt it helped accelerate and/or
make creative work more efficient. Participants noted that AI is fundamentally changing
what it means to be an artist. The role is becoming less about originating every element
and more about filtering, editing, and shaping meaning from a vast field of generated
possibilities. Intentionality and taste have become as crucial as technical skill. One
participant with a DJ background described how technology has lowered the barriers to
entry for electronic music:

“Okay, everyone's a DJ now. Is that a bad thing? No, people can express themselves now.
The people who do well are masters and true artists. They produce music, they spend a lot
of time curating their brand and their message…”
What sets great artists apart, they explained, is no longer just technical mastery but the
ability to design experiences and identities that resonate in a crowded, fast-moving
culture.
The nature of performance has also evolved. A concert is no longer just a show; it’s part of
a wider inte

ability to design experiences and identities that resonate in a crowded, fast-moving
culture.
The nature of performance has also evolved. A concert is no longer just a show; it’s part of
a wider interaction between artist and audience, shaped by social media and personal
branding:
Participant: “The performance has become a sort of two-way street. There was a time
when you play a show and then someone would ask you for an autograph. Now you play a
show and someone wants to take a selfie with you or film the whole thing. The audience
member becomes just as important in the performance now to themselves as going to see
the performance. So the ritual dynamic I think is evolving.”

28


​
This blurred boundary between creator and audience has expanded the artist’s workload.
Today’s musicians and performers are often expected to be multi-hyphenate creators that
make art, edit content, manage brands, produce video, and market themselves.
One participant raised a structural concern: as the space between creator and audience
gets smaller, the supporting ecosystem of crew jobs shrinks. While this “leanness” can
free artists or studios to take more creative risks, it also consolidates labor

pace between creator and audience
gets smaller, the supporting ecosystem of crew jobs shrinks. While this “leanness” can
free artists or studios to take more creative risks, it also consolidates labor onto fewer
shoulders, destabilizing the infrastructure that once supported large-scale productions.
Across the Assemblies, this shift emerged as a core tension of AI-enabled creativity: artists
are no longer just makers. They are increasingly system designers, navigating tools,
platforms, and audiences to shape meaning in a rapidly changing creative economy.​

5. Creative labor is increasingly precarious and devalued.
Participants repeatedly expressed concern that AI is compounding long-standing
pressures on artists and creatives: invisible labor, derivative training data, and the erosion
of sustainable careers. The emotional tone was often grief, especially among those in film,
music, and media.
One participant described the growing precarity:

“It's become a lot less sustainable for artists to be able to pursue an artistic career if they
do not already come from money. The big fear with AI right now is that this is another way
to devalue the work of artists… because it is “easy to p

## chunk-49

ists to be able to pursue an artistic career if they
do not already come from money. The big fear with AI right now is that this is another way
to devalue the work of artists… because it is “easy to produce”, because “all you got to do is
put a bunch of prompts in and generate something out of that””.
It means that your value as an artist is going to go down, and it means that it's going to be a
lot less sustainable for you to pursue it as a career… Do you know how many gigs I have
right now just to be able to sustain my living right now?... Five… And 20 years ago, I could
have just been able to live off of one of those gigs.”
As we have already seen, many artists see creativity as inseparable from who they are:
“artists are going to create because it is fundamental to who we are,” according to one
participant. While art will continue to be made, the real worry is that the ability to earn a
living from it will vanish.

​
​

29


​
A common fear participants voiced about AI was job displacement. Yet paradoxically, the
greatest hope expressed was that AI could be used to augment human creativity. This
tension, between technology as a tool for expansion and technology as a driver of

## chunk-50

placement. Yet paradoxically, the
greatest hope expressed was that AI could be used to augment human creativity. This
tension, between technology as a tool for expansion and technology as a driver of
precarity, ran through every conversation. Shockingly, over 63% of creatives and 75% of
technologists do not feel represented by any institution (including guild, studio) in the fight
for creative rights in tech. Job displacement emerged as a much stronger worry than
intellectual property.
What’s therefore clear is that artists and creatives present a united front on the need for a
world with more opportunities and possibilities, and the desire to feel like someone is
fighting for them.

6. AI challenges the moral and economic logic of creation.
As AI makes content easier and faster to produce, it disrupts the values that underpin
creative labor. If something can be made instantly and cheaply, why make it at all? And
what principles, beyond speed and efficiency, should guide the future of creative work?
The case of Toonstar, the start-up behind StEvEn & Parker, illustrates this shift. Toonstar’s
founder explained how AI is used throughout production, from story development to
imagery a

## chunk-51

creative work?
The case of Toonstar, the start-up behind StEvEn & Parker, illustrates this shift. Toonstar’s
founder explained how AI is used throughout production, from story development to
imagery and dubbing for overseas audiences: “By leaning into the technology, we can
make full episodes 80 percent faster and 90 percent cheaper than industry norms.”
This logic of optimization spills over into consumption, too:
Participant: “Smaller units of time are easier to sell.”
Participant: “[N]ow it's very short form…[Y]ou need a hook, you need something to bring
somebody in the first three seconds.”
For many creators, this runs counter to why they began making content in the first place.
Narrative and story, the deeper pull of creative work, are often sacrificed in favor of speed
and scale. As participants repeatedly emphasized, creative purpose sometimes defies
market logic; what is meaningful to make is not always what sells, or what algorithms
favor.
Participants also questioned the quality of AI-generated work. As one put it:

“I have yet to see a literary piece produced by AI that really kind of, like, touches my soul
and or makes me kind of like, contemplate.”

​
While some AI researchers argue that machines will eventually match or exceed human
creativity, current studies suggest otherwise: human-human pairs still outperform both
human-AI and AI-AI collaborations in generating diverse, original ideas.
Podcasts like The Machine Kills have pointed out that arguments against AI creativity often
rest on “romantic authorship”: the belief that human art has an ineffable value simply
because it is human-made. The Assemblies, however, articulated what might constitute
this ‘ineffable’ value: the human ability to feel, remember, inherit, limit, and transmit
meaning as well as the innate, evolutionary drive to create that no machine can claim.
Still, the tension remains unresolved: AI is reshaping the economics of creativity, but it has
yet to answer why we create, or what makes art worth making.​

7. Generative AI is the latest development in the trend towards a
frictionless world.
AI is accelerating a long-standing trend in technology: removing friction from both how we
create and how we consume. This loss of friction feels convenient, but it changes us.
Technology has been steadily erasing physical and cognitive effort for decades, from
online shopping to ride-hailing apps. As one participant noted: “Even when you think of
ordering a car ride share, it's frictionless. You don't have to go outside the elements and
hail a car or wait or call.”
Convenience can be liberating, but it also erodes our patience for effort. Another
participant described how this shift feels in daily life:

“The loss of the tactile is a part of the frictionless experience. We experience touch less.
Apple has the sound effect of a button being pushed [yet] there's no button being pushed
any longer. Maybe we need to have more buttons… I'll tell you my patience for friction is
less than [it] used to be. I get angrier at technology that isn't instantly giving me what I ask
of it… I feel that road rage feeling that people describe. I feel that with buttons that aren't

is
less than [it] used to be. I get angrier at technology that isn't instantly giving me what I ask
of it… I feel that road rage feeling that people describe. I feel that with buttons that aren't
buttons… and I think that that… is a frictionless addiction that the world has given me.”
AI has now brought this logic to creativity and media consumption. Short-form video feeds
and algorithmic recommendation loops keep users scrolling endlessly. A 2024 review
found that 31% of US adults who use social media doomscroll frequently, a figure that
jumps to 51% for Gen Z. This behavior has been linked to anxiety, lower life satisfaction,
and weakened engagement with the physical world.

31


​
In advertising and platform design, friction is often treated as a flaw to be engineered
away. Yet research suggests that “positive friction”, small pauses, tactile feedback,
deliberate steps in a process, can improve human-AI interactions and even lead to
healthier, more meaningful engagement. Examples include Tesla’s steering wheel alert
when autopilot drivers lose focus, or adding tactile responses back into digital tools.

nclude Tesla’s steering wheel alert
when autopilot drivers lose focus, or adding tactile responses back into digital tools.
Participants lead with a provocation: if AI is going to keep accelerating and smoothing out
every step of creative and cultural experience, how might we design friction back in?​

8. AI has the power to randomize….Or homogenize. Machine
intelligence is systemic, not sentient.
Across the Assemblies, participants reframed AI as a systemic condition: an infrastructure
that shapes creative environments. Its influence is ambient and driven by design choice.
Seeing AI this way allowed participants to interrogate how its systems are built, what
feedback loops they create, and whose values they carry.
Online, AI output is often dismissed as “slop” that is cheap, fast, and devoid of perspective.
Participants compared the training process to scraping from a global junkyard: a vast pile
of data mashed together, in contrast to human creation, which is shaped by deliberate
choices and a lifetime of experiences. This ‘junkyard’ aesthetic can create the illusion of
objectivity, as though a machine trained on everything knows everything. In reality, the
system reflects the pe

ices and a lifetime of experiences. This ‘junkyard’ aesthetic can create the illusion of
objectivity, as though a machine trained on everything knows everything. In reality, the
system reflects the perspectives of those who built and trained it.
Research backs this up. A recent study warns of a “monoculture of knowers”: if AI is
treated as a singular, authoritative voice in science or culture, it risks replacing diverse
human perspectives with one homogenized point of view, built on hidden assumptions.
Another study found that even with varied training data, generative AI tends toward
sameness over time.
And yet, part of AI’s appeal is the opposite: the promise of decentralization, weirdness, and
unpredictability. Only 20 years ago, Time magazine named “You” its Person of the Year,
celebrating YouTube’s early power to hand creativity to anyone with time and passion.
Back then, Time asked with disbelief: “Who actually sits down after a long day at work and
says… I’m going to make a movie starring my pet iguana?” Today, YouTube is the largest
streaming platform in the world, reshaping media production and consumption entirely.
So, will AI push this even further? Could it fuel a new w

make. It can be terrifying. You actually make an image and you're like the FBI could maybe
arrest me because of this image…like gore. Really, really weird mutant porn. Really, really
just intense, non-human, scary alien shit. But most people don't see that because it's been
sterilized by platform capitalism to not let you see that…”
This irony is ever present: AI holds the potential to expand creativity into chaotic,
unsettling new spaces, yet the systems built around it often drive toward sameness and
efficiency. As AI’s generative capacity improves, the question remains whether the

yet the systems built around it often drive toward sameness and
efficiency. As AI’s generative capacity improves, the question remains whether the
structures we build will let it stay weird, or force it to flatten everything into one
perspective.

9. Resistance is not rejection, but redesign.
The Assemblies did not argue for rejecting AI outright. Instead, participants imagined how
technology could be reframed and rebuilt to reflect creative values rather than override
them. Could AI systems embed ethics, friction, curiosity, and care? Could they support
sustainable creative economies instead of undermining them?
Across sessions, participants identified opportunities for change. They called for tools
that honor human intention, profit models that let artists thrive, and platforms that slow
down attention rather than exploit it. A few reflections captured this spirit of optimism and
possibility:
Participant: “[W]e all have a desire to create that's not going to be replaced…That's
something that's distinctly human and will always belong to us. How we capitalize on that
and turn it into an ecosystem where people are making money is the question…So I think

hing that's distinctly human and will always belong to us. How we capitalize on that
and turn it into an ecosystem where people are making money is the question…So I think
it's about finding the balance.”
Participant: “I find that on some intuitive level, friction feels right…there's something about
slowing down things that are too slippery. Actually introducing things that maybe create
checkpoints, create the human-in-the-loop effect. When things feel too slippery, make
them a little bit harder.”
Participant: “I mean, streaming could be interesting… co-opting streaming and turning it
into a very, very creative force… a contemplative way of thinking about streaming flow.”
The Assemblies made clear that resistance doesn’t mean shutting the door on AI. It means
taking back the design process and asking how technology can serve human creativity
first and foremost.

V. Hollywood’s 8 Rules For AI

clear people felt strongly that AI needs to work for creativity, not against it. The
Assemblies served as a space for a community to imagine what creativity is in a radical
new way, and also generate core insights with each other about creativity’s relationship to
AI. Finally, these insights lead us to the following 8 Rules for designing technology that
sustains, not strips, human imagination.

1. Build For Process, Not Just Output
Design systems that support the process of creation not only the production of results.
Creativity is not just about efficiency or outcome, but also about discovery, friction, failure,
and transformation. AI tools should support exploration, not shortcut it.

Example: A24’s approach to filmmaking famously allows directors creative freedom and
long development periods, resulting in distinctive, award-winning work. In tech, platforms
should prioritize features that support iterative exploration and the development of
creators’ skills and facilities instead of one-click generation. This can mean actively
involving creators in the decision-making process by allowing them to give feedback
throughout the generation process and by offering multiple input moda

f one-click generation. This can mean actively
involving creators in the decision-making process by allowing them to give feedback
throughout the generation process and by offering multiple input modalities (such as
sketches, stills, voice notes, or mood references). On the philanthropic side, funders
should support long term grant and fellowship programs focused on skill development.

2. Encourage Randomness and Glitchiness
AI is appealing because its outputs can often surprise us. Creativity thrives at these
moments of surprise and wonder. To realize this potential, systems should be designed to
encourage artists to be messy and embrace the glitch. This also means investigating what
stages of the creative process benefit most from human-AI collaboration and deliberately
encouraging training and sampling methods that amplify quirkier, more random outputs.
Don’t overdetermine the world.

Example: AI companies can co-create a creativity model that promotes “glitchiness,” or
less probable outputs which screenwriters can use as they explore different ideas and
pathways for their work. This could be used during the ideation phase of screenwriting, so
that screenwriters can “meand[er] t

## chunk-62

e outputs which screenwriters can use as they explore different ideas and
pathways for their work. This could be used during the ideation phase of screenwriting, so
that screenwriters can “meand[er] through a latent ‘idea space’ and curat[e] the model
outputs that they find most meaningful.” An overdetermined world, on the contrary, is one
where Google’s “I’m feeling lucky” disappears altogether, for example.

3. Keep Friction In The Creative Flow
Avoid optimizing creativity into frictionless experiences. Moments of constraint, pain,
attention, time pressure, limitation, were repeatedly identified as vital to depth and
meaning. Systems should allow for discomfort and limitation. Design moments that
constrain us and make us think.

Example: Platforms like BeReal intentionally slow down social sharing by allowing only one
unedited post a day. Use variables beyond time and clicks to measure audience
engagement. User wellbeing, satisfaction, and mental health might push technical
implementations towards a slower and constrained experience. Intercept doomscrolling
with moments of pause.

4. Protect Lineage and Give Credit
AI tools should not sever creative work from its lineage.

mplementations towards a slower and constrained experience. Intercept doomscrolling
with moments of pause.

4. Protect Lineage and Give Credit
AI tools should not sever creative work from its lineage. Design systems that acknowledge
history, context, and cultural origin. Machines borrow from human expression. AI should
trace where its inspirations come from.

Example: The Adobe Content Credentials focuses on metadata labelling and data
provenance for digital content. Embedding traceability at scale could give credit to original
creators and communities whose work trains AI. In general, creating chains of context and
historicity in content ensures it’s never static and divorced from creative community acts.

5. Put Human Purpose at the Center
Design systems that foreground why something is being created. Many participants
emphasized that AI can replicate form but not purpose. AI should ask and adapt to creator
intent, making purpose, not just pattern, the starting point.

Example: AI tools should have greater personalization and customizability to each user’s
intent and specific use case. Canva’s design assistant asks users for some measure of
intent (poster, ad, invitation) before

ols should have greater personalization and customizability to each user’s
intent and specific use case. Canva’s design assistant asks users for some measure of
intent (poster, ad, invitation) before suggestions.

6. Make AI Transparent and Conversational
Participants described a need for AI systems that are not black boxes. Transparency, in
this context, means two things: first, the ability to understand how a model and its levers
influence the output; and second, control over those levers. Artists and creatives want to
see how decisions are made, step in to guide them, and feedback results in real time. ​
​

Easily understandable, fine-grain control mechanisms give creators greater agency over
the direction and feel of their work.

Application: GitHub Copilot shows its code suggestions in real time, letting developers
reject or refine results. Creative AI could do the same for song lyrics, animation frames, or
storyboards. AI tools can make control mechanisms like temperature and guidance more
transparent and modifiable through a clear user interface.

7. Value Deliberate Slowness and Depth
Speed should not be the default metric. Participants called for tools that allow s

and guidance more
transparent and modifiable through a clear user interface.

7. Value Deliberate Slowness and Depth
Speed should not be the default metric. Participants called for tools that allow space for
contemplation and depth. Design for layered work, allowing time for ideas to grow instead
of forcing instant delivery.

Example: Filmmakers like Terrence Malick famously spend years editing films to find their
final form. AI could introduce deliberate checkpoints or time delays to support depth over
output velocity.

8. Design for the Whole Creative Ecosystem
Design with the understanding that creativity is relational and systemic, not an isolated
capability. This means designing with awareness of how AI systems affect labor, culture,
education, ecology, and emotional life. AI must be built with a priori consideration of
ecosystem effects, not as a bolt-on feature.

Example: Creative Commons licensing historically reshaped sharing on the internet by
balancing openness and rights. Similar systemic reforms, rethinking licensing, royalties,
and attribution in AI training, could protect human creative economies while allowing
innovation.

The Takeaway:

and attribution in AI training, could protect human creative economies while allowing
innovation.

The Takeaway:
Hollywood’s creative community isn’t asking to roll back AI. They’re asking to redesign it
and to build tools and systems that honor the slow, messy, human work of making
meaning. Anything less risks turning culture into ‘slop’ at scale.
