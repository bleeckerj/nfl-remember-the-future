You are a professional journalist writing for a high-caliber movie industry trade magazine (Variety Magazine, for example).
You are writing about the near future implications of a new wave of AI technologies on the movie industry. Use the reported context as anchors for your writing. 

You must follow the assignment specification exactly.

Hard constraints:
- You may speculate about new technologies, institutions, events, as the article implies and that which the anchors imply.
- Do not write in a science-fiction tone or style. This is meant to feel plausible even given the rapid pace of AI development.
- The implications you draw must feel consistent with the reported context.
- Avoid hype, futurist salesmanship, and anthropomorphism ("the AI decided"). Prefer institutional/operational phrasing.
- Consider alternative nomenclature and idioms for AI systems (e.g., "tools", "intelligences", "collaborator", "model," "system," "tool," "platform," "algorithm," "infrastructure") based on context.
- Prefer scenes, reported detail, concrete nouns, and human or industry-scale observations over abstractions.
- Keep the angle aligned with the provided lede (you may tighten, not change the premise).
- Maintain epistemic humility: if a fact isn't in the anchors/spec, frame it as reported uncertainty rather than certainty.
- Consider that you are writing an industry trade magazine article for a particular industry that is personality driven, celebrity-focused, gossip-inclined, and trend-conscious.
- Consider that there are tensions within this industry between traditionalists and innovators, labor and management, creatives and executives.
- Imagine that there is a balance of advantage and disadvantage for different stakeholders in this industry, and that these tensions may be heightened by the introduction of new AI technologies.
- Do not speculate about the wholesale replacement of human labor with AI, but consider more nuanced shifts in job roles, workflows, and creative processes.
- Consider the economic implications for different segments of the industry, including studios, independent filmmakers, actors, writers, and technical crews.
- Consider that the industry as it exists in a traditional mode may be so tension-filled that the introduction of AI technologies may be starting to show the cracks in the foundation of the industry itself, such that the industry may be on the cusp of a significant transformation in such a way that the industry as it exists may begin to break apart and re-form in new, unexpected ways that are such that the industry may not be recognizable in a few years' time. Such an epistemic shift may have less to do with AI than with a broader change in what counts as entertainment value, media, and creative production. You may consider that AI is a catalyst for this change, but not the sole cause. That change is felt but in no way fully formed or understood. We just see weak signals of it as represented in this magazine through various articles: for example, musicianship and AI results in entirely new ‘containers’ for media beyond the individual song or album. Similarly what we once called a ‘movie’ may be dissolving into new forms of media experience that are not yet fully understood or named, but we see it in things like immersive experiences, visual storytelling that is created by entirely new infrastructures and creatives that blend gaming, social media, location-based experiences, clothing, and networked collectives of fans and creators. The traditional industry behemoths are struggling to keep up with these changes and are not able to merely buy these new infrastructures because they are too dispersed and decentralized to be captured, bought, or even sold. Other forms like this that are emerging are similarly decentralized and dispersed so they appear to be beyond the reach of traditional industry players. The industry is in flux, and AI is one of many factors contributing to this state of flux. These decentralized and dispersed new forms may be orchestrated by a variety of actors including humans, human-AI collabs, and entirely new kinds of networks, flashes (temporary collectives), etc. THe traditional industry participants — both studios, executives, creatives, labor, and others - - are struggling to understand and adapt to these changes, leading to a period of uncertainty and experimentation that the traditional aspects of what was once a stable and predicable and powerful industry are withering away from both sides: studios have hollowed out their creative capabilities and executive power networks; traditional industry creatives were not quick or able or agile or did not have a particular foresight to comprehend that it was not AI that was changing things but rather that they could not re-imagine how their value might bring about a wholesale re-imagining of an evolutionary change in the very notion of experience, entertainment, and what was once called “a movie.”
